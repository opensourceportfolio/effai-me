Due to local social norms, I pretended to be ecstatic and requested to see the house. He pulled out his phone and showed me some pictures. To my horror, this is a 4 bedroom 4 bathroom house for him and his wife.</p><p name="4416" id="4416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, I know better than to question this decision. Especially after he already bought it. But thankfully he brought it up himself. He told me that the reason he needed such a large house is because occasionally his parents and his wife’s parents like to visit. That’s definitely a noble reason.</p><p name="749c" id="749c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, there’s the other 49 weeks of the year when you live there just you and your wife. Even if you pop out twins in the next 9 months, you still have one extra bedroom. Of course most self respecting North American would then turn that into an “Office”. You know, like that room many households have that no one goes into.</p><p name="add9" id="add9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Great! Another wise financial decision. Now what about the maintenance? What about the taxes on the property? What about the bills? What about not being able to find your wife because your house is too big? Why is it such a desirable status of success?</p></div></div></section>
