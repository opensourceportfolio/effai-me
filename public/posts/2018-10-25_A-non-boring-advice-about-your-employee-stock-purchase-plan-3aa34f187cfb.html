One of them is called an ESPP or employee stock purchase plan. It is a scheme by which the employer incentivizes you to purchase its stock using a portion of your salary. The incentive is usually some sort of a discount or top up.</p><p name="6b55" id="6b55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One question that frequently comes up is what to do once the shares are vested into your account.</p><p name="f097" id="f097" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can go down one of two roads. First, you can sell all the shares immediately and purchase something else. Spoiler alert, I’m in this camp.</p><p name="9c25" id="9c25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, you can keep the shares.</p><p name="36b7" id="36b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reasoning for keeping the shares is actually quite solid. If you’ve made money on the stock market and you’ve held the shares for less than a year, you are subject to good old fashion <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">income</strong> tax. If, on the other hand, you held it for more than a year, you are subject to shiny new <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">capital gains</strong> tax; and you guessed it, the shiny new capital gains taxes are usually lower.</p><p name="4c4a" id="4c4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is exactly the argument I was having with my friend Aaron at work yesterday. Our shares from ESPP are set to vest in November and he was inquiring about my plans for the money. I told him I was going to sell everything and purchase a boring and dull index fund. He told me I was crazy for throwing my money away.</p><p name="c2e2" id="c2e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This discussion went on for longer then I am ready to admit but I thought I can summarize the lessons here. Also, since this is my blog, my opinion is right.</p><p name="56d8" id="56d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s start with an example: Since Aaron is a well paid executive of a small company, his household income is $300,000. That puts Aaron at the 24% tax bracket. Aaron’s company offers a 15% discount on the share price. Finally, Aaron commits $20,000 to the ESPP plan.</p><p name="6487" id="6487" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, it’s important to note that only your gains are taxed — not your entire investment. In this case, if you were to sell the shares immediately after vesting, your discount would be your only gain. In other words, 15% of $20,000 or $3000.</p><p name="c4a0" id="c4a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, uncle Sam would come calling for his portion of those $3000 at the end of the year. His share would be 24% of $3000 or $720 — that’s what you owe the government.</p><p name="58b6" id="58b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Third, if you were to keep the shares for a year, you are still not scot-free. The capital gains tax is still 15% of $3000 or $450.</p><p name="699b" id="699b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By holding on to the shares for an entire year, you’ve saved yourself less than $270 ($720 minus $450) or roughly 1% of the entire sum. To put that into perspective, my company’s stock went down 4% yesterday (and up 17% today).</p><p name="fae7" id="fae7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I don’t know about you but that does not seem like a good deal to me. Putting money in a single company is notoriously volatile. Doing it with the company you work for is a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1008712386485424000" data-href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1008712386485424000" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">potential disaster</a>.</p></div></div></section><section name="1de7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="574d" id="574d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Of course, this is a somewhat contrived example. There are many other things to take into account</p><ol class="postList"><li name="eac9" id="eac9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">If you’re filing individually and earning above $200,000, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">gap </strong>between the income tax and capital gains tax is 20% instead of 9%. If you’re earning $38,000, the gap is actually negative (the income tax is lower). You can find the latest rates <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/" data-href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li name="df77" id="df77" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If you contribute significantly more than $20,000 into the ESPP program your tax loss might be greater. Of course, that also means you must keep more money in a single stock.</li><li name="c9f2" id="c9f2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If the incentive from your employer is larger, your tax could be greater. For example, when purchasing ESPP shares, my employer uses either the price today or the one from 6 months ago — whichever one is lower. As of this writing, the stock is up 10% from 6 months ago. My taxable gain is now higher.</li></ol><p name="738f" id="738f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It is worth evaluating your exact situation to determine how much money you are actually saving.</p><p name="b561" id="b561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, I don’t want to imply that saving a couple of hundred bucks isn’t worth the time — it certainly is. I will gladly give my insurance company a call if it saves me money. That lizard has been good to me.</p><p name="3965" id="3965" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, these savings don’t come for free. You are leaving a significant amount of money in a stock that you may or may not want to own.</p><p name="eede" id="eede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Therefore; my advice to you is this. Sell the damn shares. Put them in <a href="https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager" data-href="https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">betterment</a>.
