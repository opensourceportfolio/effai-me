Thank you for writing this. I do disagree with #2 and your conclusion though.</p><p name="ba20" id="ba20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, in point #2 you talk about taking care of what is most urgent. I think the whole point of the deathbed story is to remind you that what you think is most urgent isn’t all the urgent at all and won’t make much of a difference for you. As a teen, I thought that watching a lot of TV was urgent because I would be more up to date with cultural events and could have more interesting conversations with girls. I regret the wasted time now. No need to wait for my deathbed even. The deathbed story tries to illustrate what is truly and consistently important throughout life so that those things don’t fall by the wayside.</p><p name="2834" id="2834" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Additionally, I think your conclusion is somewhat contradictory to your core point in the article. If you follow the research on happiness — as you advice to do — you’ll find that it is more or less a rehash of some of those points brought up by the nurse. There is certainly more to it. However, keeping in touch with friends and being true to yourself is definitely covered in many books.</p><p name="56be" id="56be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Overall great article though. I really enjoyed reading it!</p></div></div></section>
