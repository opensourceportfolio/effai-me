I was looking forward to earning money. My pay was going to be in the thousands. I was excited to wear dress shirts and pants and walk around downtown looking important. It was a big change from my university days. Then the recession happened.</p><p name="325c" id="325c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wasn’t knowledgeable enough to understand it at the time. I know some people struggled to find work. My dad lost his job. It would take him another 8 months to find another. I, on the other hand, being a phenomenal performer, was spared (thankfully).</p><p name="f4a3" id="f4a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I do remember the protests on wall street and all the TV coverage they got. They called themselves the 99%. I must have been one of them.</p><p name="5d66" id="5d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We were angry about the bailouts. The bankers were saved from bankruptcy despite being responsible for the crash — and our money was used to save them!</p><p name="671c" id="671c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It certainly seemed unfair to me.</p><p name="87f9" id="87f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what could we do? Letting these companies fail would mean the loss of thousands of additional jobs. “It would cripple the economy”.</p><p name="997f" id="997f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We also set a certain expectation. The corporations now understood: once you got large enough, the tax payer will bail you out. We even coined the term “too big to fail”.</p></div></div></section><section name="627e" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c949" id="c949" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Last week, my friend Ivan and I were discussing this exact topic. What could we do about it? And how could we have avoided this? This time however, being more mature and sophisticated, I’ve had the clarity to voice an alternative opinion. I thought it would be good to share it here with you, dear audience.</p><p name="5d97" id="5d97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ask yourself, what does GEICO do to insure your claim? They charge a premium of course. You pay a monthly fee for the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">insurance</strong> that someone will cover you in case of a loss. Naturally, you cover for large losses that would hurt you financially.</p><p name="06dc" id="06dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You might see where I’m going with this.</p><p name="5033" id="5033" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can determine which companies are “too big to fail”; we can use an income or employee count threshold or another metric (or a combination). Once a company crosses that income level (or employee count), each additional dollar earned would be subject to double the tax rate.</p><p name="5338" id="5338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before all my libertarian friends lose their shit, let me explain.</p><p name="7ef8" id="7ef8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can view the additional tax as a premium paid into a bailout fund. In case of gross mismanagement and undue risk, the responsibility of bailing out these large corporation doesn’t fall on the tax payer but on the companies themselves.</p><p name="cc8a" id="cc8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In reality, no prudent corporation would be willing to pay more tax than necessary. Instead, as the corporation approaches this limit, they will likely split into sub-units.</p><p name="e427" id="e427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Amazon would become Amazon AWS and Amazon Retail; Microsoft would become Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows, Walmart would become Walmart East and Walmart West. You get the idea.</p><p name="6948" id="6948" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d be lying if I told you I came up with this idea myself.

You really can’t think of a way to break up Amazon? Amazon does <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">everything</strong>.</p><p name="c402" id="c402" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And Google? It happens to be a great example of this principal — although in a much milder form. It has a holding company, Alphabet, and it spins out experimental companies, Waymo, Sidewalk Labs, etc.</p><p name="0455" id="0455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, no company is forced to spin out every single line of business they have. If a business isn’t mature yet to stand on its own — if it’s a money loser for example — keep it. Every decision is completely up to the board and shareholders.</p><p name="e5ff" id="e5ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, some people are worried that large companies will lose their competitive advantage; efficiencies of scale or something along those lines. Maybe. But that’s debatable. It could equally play out in the opposite direction.</p><p name="ece6" id="ece6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine for instance if Amazon decided to spin out its warehousing operations. Wouldn’t other companies benefit from all the efficiencies gained by Amazon?</p><p name="5fda" id="5fda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You might be asking if a company would even bother investing in innovation if they’ll spin it off. My answer to you is of course! The investment in innovation doesn’t just disappear. It is sold. A shareholder with one share of Amazon, after the split, would end up with one share of Amazon — priced X dollars lower— and one share of the new company — priced at X. That’s just how spin offs work.</p><p name="5c8b" id="5c8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The end result of such policy is no corporate bailouts, no Dodd, no Frank, no endless bickering, no bureaucrats and no government agencies. This is a way to create the right incentives for the companies to behave while making our economy <a href="https://amzn.to/2QMgEp7" data-href="https://amzn.to/2QMgEp7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Antifragile</a> (or at least robust).</p><div name="0eb0" id="0eb0" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile" data-href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">Antifragile</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">From the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the foremost philosophers of our time, Nassim Nicholas Taleb…</em>www.goodreads.com</a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="574f868aa47f204aca4a8b218c735de2" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*1OXm30F3StN0zx8s" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*1OXm30F3StN0zx8s);"></a></div></div></div></section>
