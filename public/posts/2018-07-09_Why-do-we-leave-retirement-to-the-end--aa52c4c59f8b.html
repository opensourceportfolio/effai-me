It is honestly one of my favorite past time activities. On the surface, it is a very simple concept. Save a bunch of money. Keep going until you supplement your living expenses. Conversation over, right? Wrong. Turns out, there’s a lot more to it.</p><p name="510a" id="510a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I ended up having an interesting discussion recently with my colleagues Troy and Nina over beer (all good conversations involve beer). The question we deliberated was this:</p><blockquote name="31f2" id="31f2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Why do we leave retirement to the end?</blockquote><p name="1944" id="1944" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you’re in the traditional mindset of retiring at 65, this might seem like an odd question. How else would you have it? On the other hand, If you’ve discovered the wonderful world of financial independence, it’s a perfectly fair question. Why do we leave it to the end?</p><p name="017c" id="017c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The end can certainly be very long. You can stay retired for 60 years. But it still comes after continuous chunk of work.</p><p name="ca85" id="ca85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what’s the alternative? One option is to take 6 months off right now. Do your thing. Then come back and work some more.</p><p name="ddc3" id="ddc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This actually has a great benefit. You get to discover what it’s like to be financially independent without having to wait for years for your savings to accumulate. It’s like shopping at Costco without membership. Fantastic!</p><p name="7e31" id="7e31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first time I heard about this concept was back around 2011 when I read <a href="https://medium.com/u/56d3bc91794f" data-href="https://medium.com/u/56d3bc91794f" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="56d3bc91794f" data-action-value="56d3bc91794f" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss</a>’s 4 hour work week. In the book he talks about having mini retirements throughout your working life. I thought the idea was profound. It definitely changed the way I viewed retirement.</p><div name="902e" id="902e" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">The New York Times bestselling author of The 4-Hour Body shows readers how to live more and work less, now with more…</em>www.amazon.com</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="d2f99a99ea6e7ba2bcc6a8e501907033" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*-VMWxd---Zw1oNwe" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*-VMWxd---Zw1oNwe);"></a></div><p name="47ba" id="47ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed">Except there’s a problem. Lunches aren’t free. In this case, it’s your <a href="https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a" data-href="https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">TTF</a> (Time To Financial independence). If you are taking time off work to travel and “find yourself”, you’re not earning any money. If you’re doing it for 6 months, you just set yourself back by 6 months.</p><p name="0517" id="0517" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It gets worse. Since you are unable to perform photosynthesis, you also end up spending money. Your TTF moves back by an additional number of months it would take you to save what you’ve just spent. It can be summarized as follows:</p><blockquote name="02f8" id="02f8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Your TTF moves forward by the amount you save and moves back by the amount you earn.</blockquote><p name="cf40" id="cf40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">You save less than 100% of what you earn. Hence, it will take you longer to make up the hole in your savings than the time you took off.</p><p name="3e08" id="3e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a second downside to the concept of mini-retirements. People seeking financial independence (effai seekers) tend to fall in one of two (or both) camps.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="7591" id="7591" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">You are looking for <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">freedom </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the work schedules.</li><li name="d643" id="d643" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You are looking for <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">security </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the business cycle.</li></ul><p name="4575" id="4575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Mini-retirements address the freedom part at the expense of security part.</p><p name="8fbc" id="8fbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine you’re a technology worker in 1999. You decide you’re burned out. You’d like to take 6 months off and travel to Thailand. Great! except when you come back, there’s no job waiting for you. It’s likely you won’t have another one for a while. Once you do get one, it’s going to be half the salary.</p><p name="abd4" id="abd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">None of this means you can’t be financially independent but recessions and economic downturns are things most people want to avoid. One such way is financial independence.</p></div></div></section><section name="7cd7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a32a" id="a32a" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Does this mean my professional opinion is that mini-retirements are a bad idea? Absolutely not.</p><p name="615d" id="615d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">You could mitigate the downsides by taking less time off. 3 months might suffice to find who you really are. The damage to your TTF is eased and your employer might even agree to keep your position open for you. Just be aware of the risks. I have been always too scared to take the time off.</p></div></div></section>
