I flew over on Thursday and planning to stay until Monday morning. The plan is to have a surprise birthday party. My mom is making all the arrangements and it’s growing to be quite the headache with all the details but I’m sure he’s going to love it.</p><p name="e9e0" id="e9e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One thing did stand out to me though. My mom was going over some of the planning and casually mentioned that for my dad’s 50th birthday, I made him a really great montage. Everyone at his birthday loved it and since then it’s been a tradition to have one at all of their friends milestones. However, she said that for this one, it wasn’t really necessary.</p><p name="dd57" id="dd57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally, I inquired as to why she thought so and she explained that although it’s been a decade since the last video, she feels like this video would be essentially the same. “Not much has changed” was her exact quote. There was basically nothing worthy to show people.</p><p name="54ea" id="54ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This bothers me for several reasons. First and foremost, it bothers me because I feel sad for them. I feel like you let an entire decade slip by and haven’t even done enough with it to share the highlights with the people closest to you.</p><p name="14bd" id="14bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, the days the I do nothing tend to be the days that are least memorable (naturally). I would imagine that there is probably a similar effect to weeks, months, years and decades. You can live your entire life without doing much at all.</p><p name="3189" id="3189" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Finally, I was angry. I was angry because I can’t understand how she wasn’t bothered by it. Why is it okay in her mind to have your life pass you by. Of course based on my “Don’t be an asshole rule” I didn’t say any of this and I doubt she’ll ever read it.</p></div></div></section>
