It was a ton of fun and I felt great after it. One fear that I had though is the way meetings tend to run in corporate environments. Usually, you have a bunch of people around a table, staring at their laptops while one person talks for 30–60 minutes.</p><p name="5a8e" id="5a8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now I love listening to my own voice just as much as the next guy. Possibly even more then the next guy. However, I didn’t want my presentation to turn to something boring and unproductive. Not only would I find it demoralizing, but I’ve also just wasted the time of every attendee.</p><p name="f1aa" id="f1aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To my surprise, not only were most people paying close attention to what I was saying, but they actually did what in my opinion is the biggest signal to let someone know you’re paying attention. They asked followup questions! That’s a big deal in my book. It shows that you’re aware of the context and you’re thinking. You realize something isn’t covered and you are curious to know more.</p><p name="b852" id="b852" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Thankfully, my presentation involved a lot of followup questions and I was more then happy to dive a little deeper and explain it all. Overall a fantastic experience and I’d love to do it again.</p></div></div></section>
