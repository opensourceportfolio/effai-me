You’re sitting at a table with a group of friends discussing your weight loss goals. Your friend Nina wants to lose 10 pounds before her trip to Jamaica while your buddy Joseph is looking to fit into the jeans he wore last year. The topic of diet inevitably comes up. You are on that hipster low carb diet. Nina is on a strict low fat yogurt diet. Joseph is counting his calories and tracking them on <a href=\"https://www.myfitnesspal.com/\">MyFitnessPal</a>.</p><p>Naturally, everyone starts sharing their theories about how to lose weight. “It’s calories in versus calories out” Joseph declares to the group. “No! pasta makes you fat” you counter. Then Nina drops the following bomb: “You just need to eat in moderation”. Boom. Case closed. We can all go home now.</p><h3>What she meant by moderation</h3><p>The idea of moderation can be applied to many issues in life but to keep things simple lets continue using diet as an example. What does one mean when they say moderation is key? In the case of diet, it means focusing on a single aspect of the diet is the wrong approach. If only you did not consume anything in excess, everything else would work itself out. Naturally.</p><p>Presumably, if you were eating a balanced diet of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, you wouldn’t need to worry about how much calories you’re burning or if carbohydrates make you gain weight. Your body would just handle it automatically. This is a very common advice and seems very sensible at first.</p><h3>Problems with moderation</h3><p>If the advice is sensible at first, what could be the problem? I can see at least three possible issues with it.</p><h4>Moderation does not tell me what is moderate.</h4><p>Let’s say someone is asking you what is an acceptable amount of alcohol to consume in a week. If you were to tell them to consume a moderate amount, it’s not clear at all when they’ve exceeded that moderation. Is it 2 beers a night or 2 beers a week? The difference is a factor of 7!</p><p>Another question is, moderate for what purpose? Are you trying to optimize for health, pregnancy or a 10 year old? In that case you may want to drink nilch beers. That’s vastly different from the advice you’d get from <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Alcohol-and-Heart-Health_UCM_305173_Article.jsp\">AHA</a> for a 30 year old male in perfect physical form.</p><blockquote>Generally, advising moderation is somewhere between useless and dead obvious.</blockquote><h4>Moderation as an escape hatch.</h4><p>Occasionally, you’ll be speaking about topics that are relatively complicated. If there is a lot of nuances or a lot of uncertainty surrounding these nuances, the moderation card tends to come up frequently. It is used as a way to summarize any of the uncertainties as just go with your gut.</p><blockquote>There’s more unanswered questions than what I’m comfortable discussing</blockquote><p>For example, consider the topic of budgeting. Everyone has an opinion about how to budget, what to include in the budget and to what granularity. The longer you’ve been doing it, the more opinions you have. However, you’ll always find someone to tell you to spend in moderation. If you spend in moderation, you don’t need a budget.</p><p>Ask them if they’ve ever tried to budget to test if that statement is true. The answer is probably no.</p><h4>Moderation implies normality. Normality may have shifted.</h4><p>Another common implication of moderation is to not be too far away from society’s average. In other words,</p><blockquote>Don’t do anything society would consider extreme</blockquote><p>However, what society tends to think is extreme is just outside of what is normal; and normal isn’t always right. For example, you could ask me what is a reasonable amount to save. If I told you to save moderately or normally, it just means saving 0 — 10% of your salary depending on where we are in the business cycle in North America.</p><p>What if instead I told you to save 50% of your salary? That would be extreme right? Wrong! First, it wouldn’t be very far away from the historical savings rates and how much people in other societies save. Second, it would be great for your household in the long term. Sticking to the average is a losing proposition in this case. However, you can’t see that through the eyes of moderation.</p><p>I am not claiming that moderation has no place in good advice. It does. Sometimes. I am saying though that you shouldn’t allow vagueness, laziness and people’s fear of judgement affect the quality of advice you dish out and receive.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a910992436c4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-case-against-moderation-a910992436c4\">The case against moderation</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Something clicked today that I should have realized much earlier. Nothing groundbreaking and earth shattering like my usual rants but still an interesting realization. I was always under the impression that each time I cheated and had an “improper” meal, I was breaking my diet and forcing my body to restart the entire process of fat adaptation.</p><p>Subconsciously, each time I had a bowl of rice at a restaurant or some sort of dessert that a friend baked, I thought to myself that it will be another few days to get back on track. On top of it, I fully expected to see it reflected on the scale and by the very scientific pinch test.</p><p>Nothing was further from reality. In fact, most of the time, I saw absolutely no change what so ever. Now, in hindsight, it is ridiculous to think that one bad meal or even one bad day could really cause any noticeable weight gain but there is also a slightly deeper insight. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.tuitnutrition.com/2016/01/dont-be-a-ketard1.html\">Amy Berger</a> I realized the difference between being fat adapted and being in ketosis. More importantly, I realized that just because you cheated, does not mean you’re suddenly not fat adapted.</p><p>Let’s start with an example. if you’re a typical SAD (standard American diet) consumer, eating tons of refined wheat flour, you are probably well tuned to convert glucose to energy. All the right enzymes are in place. This is your default mode and it seems to work okay for you. If you were to eat a meal high in fat but low in carbs at this point, you’d probably feel pretty cranky. Of course there’s an exact parallel to being tuned to eating and using fat for energy.</p><p>So what happens if you all of a sudden decide to cut the carbs from your high carb diet? Your body cannot get it’s energy nearly as efficiently anymore and it freaks out. It needs time to develop and express the enzymes related to oxidizing fat for energy. That helps explain why some people experience the so called “carb flu” when first switching to a low carb diet.</p><p>But my point is that this process is never an overnight event. It takes time to switch an adapt to a new form of energy. You are very likely to still be a fat burning machine the next day. Therefore; there’s worse things that you can do to your diet then once in a while having a bowl of rice.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2f4375142a09\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/worse-than-a-cheat-meal-2f4375142a09\">Worse than a cheat meal</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I don’t think they are necessarily looking for a comprehensive explanation of how insulin is related to heart disease but a simple list of dos and don’ts. This should hopefully clarify my current standing.</p><p>Let’s start with the don’ts.</p><ol><li>If you’re consuming sugar then stop. It’s just bad for you. Throw it out or burn it. Up to you.</li><li>Cut out all the grain and legume products from your diet. That includes rye, quinoa barley and buckwheat. I’m sure you eat a ton of that don’t you? Oh yeah, and wheat. That includes pasta and bread, whole wheat, whole grain, ancient grain and white. Sorry.</li><li>Stop eating low fat garbage (Anything meant to be full fat but is low fat is defined as garbage).</li><li>Eliminate vegetable oils from your diet. That includes common ones like Canola, soy, and safflower.</li></ol><p>And now the dos</p><ol><li>Replace all the foods you’ve eliminated so far with vegetables.

Google is my friend in that case so I googled top 10 causes of death in the U.S. My guess is Canada is looking somewhat similar.</p><p>Also interesting to note that there are roughly 2.6 million deaths in the U.S. annually. Although an unfortunate number, it’s a great boon for the morgue industry.</p><p>Here is what it looks like:</p><ol><li>Heart disease: 633,842 ~ 24%</li><li>Cancer: 595,930 ~ 22%</li><li>Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 155,041 ~ 6%</li><li>Accidents: 146,571 ~ 5%</li><li>Stroke: 140,323 ~ 5%</li><li>Alzheimer’s disease: 110,561 ~ 4%</li><li>Diabetes: 79,535 ~ 3%</li><li>Influenza and pneumonia: 57,062 ~ 2%</li><li>Kidney disease: 49,959 ~ 2%</li><li>Suicide: 44,193 ~ 1.7%</li></ol><p>The first thing to point out is of course how much more prevalent heart disease and cancer are. In my mind, since stroke is accumulation of plaque but in a different area, I lump it together with heart disease.</p><p>Next, there’s diabetes and Alzheimer’s which I’m convinced are rooted in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. On top of that, a lot of diabetics will die from heart disease complications so I imagine it is already reflected in (1).</p><p>I don’t know what to make of respiratory diseases and influenza. I never heard of anyone having it personally and was surprised to find these so high up. I also don’t know much about kidney disease.</p><p>Finally there’s accidents and suicide.

I could plug in a few numbers into an online calculator and get a rough idea of when I could “retire”. After all, the principal is very simple. Mark your expenses on a graph. It should be a horizontal line with a slight upward slope to account for inflation. Plot your expected passive income each year. It should be a line with a steeper upward slope. Once those two lines intersect, congratulations, you are financially independent.</p><p>Figuring out your expenses is simple. Take your income. Subtract your savings. Whatever is left is your expenses.</p><p>How about your passive income? That’s easy as well. Take your net worth — all money you have invested. Apply the 4% rule (I have yet to write about it. You can Google it for now. In short, you can consider 4% of your net worth as passive income for the year). Done.</p><p>That’s all fine and dandy while you are living in your mom’s basement like I did. At some point though, you are likely to get your own place that comes with a mortgage and its own set of responsibilities. That’s when things get tricky. The fundamental idea doesn’t change. You still need to wait for the expenses curve to intersect with the passive income curve. The complexity is identifying those expenses.</p><p>While building <a href=\"https://effai.me\">Effai.me</a> I had to think long and hard about it because I just bought my own house. I was trying to see what kind of an effect it would have on my Effai date. After combing through the interwebs and researching through the available literature, the answer was… it depends. It depends on what you want to do. Turns out, you have three choices.</p><p><strong>Sell your house. </strong>Assuming the price of the house increases over time, you may find yourself at a point where selling your house could net you a big pile of money. That could significantly shorten your time to Effai. Once you sell it, the passive income you could generate would skyrocket.</p><p>How would you know if this is a good option for you? It’s a little more involved. You have to know several things.</p><ol><li>Your mortgage payments</li><li>Your home maintenance cost</li><li>Your property tax</li></ol><p>The sum of the three above is your <strong>housing cost</strong>. In addition, you’d need to know your new <strong>rental costs</strong>. That’s just one more number.</p><ol><li>The cost to rent something equivalent.</li></ol><p>When you sell, you bring your <strong>housing cost</strong> down to zero but introduce a new expense — <strong>rental costs</strong>. The two expenses are likely in the same ballpark and mostly cancel each other out. Selling your house and renting is usually your fastest way to Effai.</p><p>Of course, most people wouldn’t dream of ever going back to renting. After all, they’ve “left college years ago”. In that case, you are left with two other options.</p><p><strong>Pay off your mortgage. </strong>In a way, this is a mirror image of selling your house. Instead of putting money to work for you, you decide to reduce your expenses. This strategy will eliminate your monthly mortgage payment (Yay!!). However, you are still left with the maintenance bill and the always increasing property tax (Boo).</p><p>This could be a great strategy if you don’t have much debt left on your mortgage. A simple rule of thumb is this:</p><blockquote>If the mortgage payoff amount cannot generate more passive income than your monthly mortgage payments, go ahead and pay off your mortgage.</blockquote><p><strong>Don’t (or never) pay off your mortgage. </strong>You probably saw this one coming. If the rule above does not hold, this is for you. You are likely to find yourself in this situation if you bought the house recently and you still have a large amount of debt left. In that case, it may be cheaper for you to just keep your expenses as they are — mortgage payments included — and have your money passively pay for those expenses. This is a temporary solution since at some point you’ll have so little debt left you may want to pay it off. However, in the interest of retiring as early as possible this is definitely a possibility.</p><p>You’ll be glad to know that <a href=\"https://effai.me\">Effai.me</a> runs all three of these scenarios for you. It is very biased towards retiring early. I hope the above made sense.

It is honestly one of my favorite past time activities. On the surface, it is a very simple concept. Save a bunch of money. Keep going until you supplement your living expenses. Conversation over, right? Wrong. Turns out, there’s a lot more to it.</p><p>I ended up having an interesting discussion recently with my colleagues Troy and Nina over beer (all good conversations involve beer). The question we deliberated was this:</p><blockquote>Why do we leave retirement to the end?</blockquote><p>If you’re in the traditional mindset of retiring at 65, this might seem like an odd question. How else would you have it? On the other hand, If you’ve discovered the wonderful world of financial independence, it’s a perfectly fair question. Why do we leave it to the end?</p><p>The end can certainly be very long. You can stay retired for 60 years. But it still comes after continuous chunk of work.</p><p>So what’s the alternative? One option is to take 6 months off right now. Do your thing. Then come back and work some more.</p><p>This actually has a great benefit. You get to discover what it’s like to be financially independent without having to wait for years for your savings to accumulate. It’s like shopping at Costco without membership. Fantastic!</p><p>The first time I heard about this concept was back around 2011 when I read <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/56d3bc91794f\">Tim Ferriss</a>’s 4 hour work week. In the book he talks about having mini retirements throughout your working life. I thought the idea was profound. It definitely changed the way I viewed retirement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week\">The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</a></p><p>Except there’s a problem. Lunches aren’t free. In this case, it’s your <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">TTF</a> (Time To Financial independence). If you are taking time off work to travel and “find yourself”, you’re not earning any money. If you’re doing it for 6 months, you just set yourself back by 6 months.</p><p>It gets worse. Since you are unable to perform photosynthesis, you also end up spending money. Your TTF moves back by an additional number of months it would take you to save what you’ve just spent. It can be summarized as follows:</p><blockquote>Your TTF moves forward by the amount you save and moves back by the amount you earn.</blockquote><p>You save less than 100% of what you earn. Hence, it will take you longer to make up the hole in your savings than the time you took off.</p><p>There’s a second downside to the concept of mini-retirements. People seeking financial independence (effai seekers) tend to fall in one of two (or both) camps.</p><ul><li>You are looking for <strong>freedom </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the work schedules.</li><li>You are looking for <strong>security </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the business cycle.</li></ul><p>Mini-retirements address the freedom part at the expense of security part.</p><p>Imagine you’re a technology worker in 1999. You decide you’re burned out. You’d like to take 6 months off and travel to Thailand. Great! except when you come back, there’s no job waiting for you. It’s likely you won’t have another one for a while. Once you do get one, it’s going to be half the salary.</p><p>None of this means you can’t be financially independent but recessions and economic downturns are things most people want to avoid. One such way is financial independence.</p><p>Does this mean my professional opinion is that mini-retirements are a bad idea? Absolutely not.</p><p>You could mitigate the downsides by taking less time off. 3 months might suffice to find who you really are. The damage to your TTF is eased and your employer might even agree to keep your position open for you. Just be aware of the risks. I have been always too scared to take the time off.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aa52c4c59f8b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-do-we-leave-retirement-to-the-end-aa52c4c59f8b\">Why do we leave retirement to the end?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Of course there is. In one scenario you get to drive a brand new SUV to work with shiny new rims and an obnoxiously loud exhaust pipe, and the other you’re po’. I don’t think I need to explain which one is which. No one would dispute this.</p><p>However 😃, there is one important assumption we made. The assumption is that being po’ (that’s short for “poor” if someone is unclear) is bad and driving an SUV is good. In other words, we are talking about a basic, familiar consumer lifestyle. That is probably a fine assumption. Nonetheless, what if you’re an effai seeker? Apparently it’s <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5241566/vicki-robin-financial-independence-retire-early/\">all the rage with millennials</a>. You’d have to reconsider those assumptions.</p><p>The reason for this is very simple. If you are seeking effai, your goal isn’t to burn through as many resources as possible during your lifetime. Your goal is to get a <em>minimum amount of resources you need — and as early as possible</em>. That’s quite a different form of consumption.</p><p>So what gets you there sooner? By being “poor” you end up spending less money.</p><p>Spending less money means you require less money to live on.</p><p>Requiring less money to live on means you can save it up faster. That’s pretty simple math.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now return to the original question: Is a penny saved, as good as a penny earned? The answer to that is absolutely not. It’s far better.</p><p>Let’s take Hank and Lenny as an example (I have debated this with my friend Hank many times although I am somewhat misrepresenting his stance). For convenience, let’s also assume they have roughly the same standard of living costing $60k annually (or $5k monthly). They also save the same $3k per month. At that rate, and with some reasonable assumptions, it would take them about 16 years to reach effai (you can check for yourself <a href=\"https://effai.me/\">here</a>). If they started at 20 and keeping life circumstances constant, they’d reach effai at 36.</p><p>Turns out though, that Hank is also a very hard worker and got promoted recently. He also got a nice pay bump to go along with a fancier title and is now able to save an <strong>extra</strong> $1k a month. In other words, he is socking away $4k monthly instead of $3k. That brings his <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>T</strong>o e<strong>F</strong>fai (TTF 😃) down to 13.7 years from 16 — a savings of 2.3 years. Not bad!</p><p>Lenny on the other hand is a cheapskate. Instead of making more money, Lenny decided to cut his expenses by $1k (Let’s ignore the how for the sake of this article). What does that mean for Lenny? Since Lenny cut his expenses, he now lives on $4k a month instead of $5k. That puts effai 13 years away. That’s an additional 0.7 years sooner than Hank.</p><p><strong>Additionally</strong>, since Lenny cut his expenses, by $1k without changing anything else, he just freed up $1k to put towards <strong>savings</strong>. Lenny is now able to also save $4k per month just like Hank. This makes effai only 11 years away — a full 5 years earlier then originally anticipated.</p><p>In short, each penny you save, from an effai view, actually has two roles. First, it’s a penny you don’t have to produce with your passive income anymore. Second, it’s a penny you can redirect towards savings — Increasing significantly your savings rate.</p><blockquote>So, no, a penny saved is not a penny earned, it’s two!</blockquote><p>There is actually one other way to look at all of this. I find this to be far more impressive to think about than 11 years versus 13.7 years. Consider instead how much less money you actually need. For example, let’s go back to Lenny. He went from spending $5k to $4k and increased his savings from $3k to $4k.</p><p>Now take the 4% rule. Oh? You’re not familiar with it? I realize that I haven’t written about it yet. I’ll summarize it super quickly for the sake of this article:</p><blockquote>You can passively earn a dollar a month forever by intelligently investing $300.</blockquote><p>Now take the 4% rule. By cutting $1k a month from what Lenny spends, Lenny does not need to intelligently invest $300k. In other words, Lenny just saved himself from saving $300k.</p><p>This gets a tiny bit better actually. You should never think of your retirement number in today’s dollars. You always have to take inflation into account. The $300k we just saved for Lenny is in today’s dollars. Since Lenny is retiring in 11 years — and with an inflation rate of 2%, Lenny shaved off a whopping $373k off his retirement number. Cha-ching.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=32a31bf45d8a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">A penny saved is a penny earned.

We talked about all the different programs Uncle Sam offers to reduce our tax bill at the end of the year. There’s the traditional ones we hear about all the time like 401k’s and IRA. There’s a mention of a few less common ones as well. I encourage you to read it if you haven’t yet.</p><p>However, one of the most controversial options I mentioned was the Health Savings Account — also known as the HSA. Turns out, some people are not aware of all the super powers of the HSA and in turn ended up paying unnecessary taxes to the government. Thus; I’ve decided to break it down for you in a digestible way.</p><p>First, let’s talk about what HSA is used for. HSA is a savings account (I bet you didn’t see that coming) that allows you to save money for <strong>medical purposes</strong>. Each dollar that you set aside in an HSA is <strong>tax free. </strong>The money in the account can be invested in the stock market and grow tax free. Once you have a medical expense, the money can be withdrawn from the account, once again, tax free. You get the idea. One caveat is that HSA is only available for <strong>high deductible health plans.</strong></p><p>Of course, the government cannot allow you to put every single penny you earn towards medical expenses. There is a limit of $3,450 per person or $6,900 for a couple per year. That’s 2018 numbers.</p><p>Here’s a quick example of how it would work. Assume your household income for 2018 is $100,000. If you were to max out your HSA for you and your spouse, the government would tax you on $93,100 instead of the entire $100,000. That’s a free, ~$1500 you don’t have to pay in taxes!</p><p>Aside from federal income tax, there’s a few other taxes snuck into your pay stub. Two of them are social security and medicare — affectionately known as FICA. Together they add up to 7.65% of your income. Turns out, <strong>unlike</strong> <strong>all </strong>other retirement accounts available to you, HSA is the only one that is exempt from paying FICA taxes too. That’s another ~$500 in your deep pockets.</p><p>That’s just the beginning though. Once you’ve set aside the money in your HSA, the most powerful force in the universe takes over — compound interest. That’s because each dollar you’ve set aside can be invested and grow tax free. Naturally, as a FI (financial independence) pursuer, you’d invest it in a diversified index fund of stocks*. Over time, the growth alone could dominate any further contributions.</p><p>Let’s also address the elephant in the room. What do you do if you don’t need to spend all this money on health care? What if you’re healthy? Once again, you’re in luck. Aside from being healthy, once you hit 65, all the money saved up in your HSA can be used for <strong>anything </strong>penalty free. You heard that right; <strong>anything. </strong>Taxation is also simple. It is treated like regular income. In essence, your HSA becomes a traditional IRA. One exception is if HSA is used for medical purposes. In that case, withdrawals are still tax free.</p><p>This beast of Roth and Traditional IRA blended and fused together sounds like a great deal, doesn’t it? Should you then go ahead and switch your health plan at work to a high deductible plan as soon as possible? Probably.</p><p>However, there is one notable exception. If you tend to have high medical bills throughout the year, it doesn’t make much sense to switch to a higher deductible health plan. You could be better off forgoing the tax savings and letting the employer subsidize your health costs instead.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that some generous employers contribute to your HSA as well. It does count against your overall limit but free money is free money.</p><p>Finally, there’s always going to be a subset of people who are terrified of exposing themselves to a little bit more risk through the high deductible health plan. I suggest that you read my article addressing insurance in general appropriately named “<a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">what to insure</a>”. To summarize it in one sentence, I’d say, don’t worry about it if you can afford it.</p><p>*I need to write something an article, or more likely a series about stock investing for the FI pursuer.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ebdd3f35be8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/hsa-a-friend-on-the-road-to-financial-freedom-ebdd3f35be8\">HSA: a friend on the road to financial freedom</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

If you are working the standard North American schedule, it would translate to 40 hours a week or 8 hours a day. Now imagine that through some innovation on your part, you are now able to produce the same number of pins at half the time. To satisfy the same demand you can now work only 4 hours a day and enjoy an additional 4 hours of leisure. Straightforward math so far.</p><p>Let’s take this a step further. This time, you’ve automated the process further and you can now produce the same number of pins at a quarter of the previous time. By the same math, now you can work an hour a day and enjoy 7 hours of additional leisure. This is essentially the reality for our productivity curve between 1950’s and today. We are far more productive today by every measure. <em>However, the number of hours we work hasn’t budged.</em></p><p>The above was a prediction by a famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, in 1930. The video is a lecture by a professor in Economics trying to answer why this prediction did not materialize. The lecture is very insightful and brings up many interesting statistics about work, prosperity and well being broken down by gender, age and race. However, his main reason as to why the number of hours we work hasn’t decreased despite much progress in productivity is our love for work and money.</p><p>Although he presents good evidence to support his case, I believe there are a couple of other reasons we are working the same 40 hour weeks as we did in the 50’s that he overlooked. I would also argue that these reasons are equally important if not more so.</p><p><strong>The system isn’t conductive to less hours. </strong>Let’s go back to our pin maker from before. If the pin maker decided to lay back and enjoy the additional 7 hours of leisure, what do you think would happen? All of her competitors would eventually figure out the same new, faster method of production and flood the market with pins since they can now produce more — each trying to wrestle away market share. In turn, that would push prices down and our (lazy) pin maker would quickly go out of business. This is the basis of capitalism.</p><p>We can thank our high standard of living to this phenomena. It brought us many innovations by aligning incentives and pushed billions of people out of poverty all around the world. It does this by rewarding work and innovation but penalizing complacency.</p><p>However, there are certainly few employers out there that have toyed with the idea of lowering work hours. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/?utm_term=.f0094467d9cd\">Amazon considered introducing a 30 hour work week for some of their employees</a>.</p><p>If we have employers that are open to this idea, why don’t the employees rise up and demand lower work hours? Do we love money this much? I think there’s another more subtle reason that is driving it beyond greed.</p><p><strong>Most people haven’t discovered their purpose. </strong>If you ever needed to describe your purpose in life, could you? Not the purpose <strong>of</strong> life, that’s also beyond the scope of this article. Your purpose in life is what you’d like to achieve or do. If you can’t, that’s okay. Few people can.</p><p>Once you free up those 7 hours of leisure time, you must have a way to fill them up with some leisure activities. If you don’t have a purpose, it’s hard to come up with things to do unless traveling the world for 40 years sounds like a good idea to you; and there’s certainly <a href=\"https://www.gocurrycracker.com/\">people who think so</a>.</p><p>I’ve encountered this a lot when I talk to people about financial independence (FI or effai 😃). The question of what I would do with all that free time immediately comes up. This question sometimes stems from curiosity and other times to ridicule the idea (read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">article</a> for my thoughts on this behaviour). I’ve spoken to countless people about FI but only a handful ever considered what they would do if they had more time.</p><p>That’s why a job is usually the de facto source of purpose and the main occupier of time for most people. Once it’s taken away, people may feel lost. That’s also why <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-retirement-may-be-the-kiss-of-death-study-finds_us_57221aa3e4b01a5ebde49eff\">early retirees seem to die earlier</a>.</p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t even be considering FI if I believed dying early was an inevitable fact and no amount of salad eating could save me. Nor would I ever recommend it to anyone else. I believe that anyone who is working towards FI the traditional way — that is, by saving hard — must at some point consider their purpose. Otherwise they could not maintain the motivation to save so much for 15 plus years. That’s a tiny minority of people though.</p><p>Hence the result. Still working 100% of the time while creating 800% the product instead of working 1/8th of the time while producing 100% of the product.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eb73548c2121\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-real-reason-economic-progress-hasnt-lowered-work-hours-more-eb73548c2121\">The real reason economic progress hasn’t lowered work hours more</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I dread it because it’s that special time of the year. It’s the time you have to gather all those illegible slips you received from your employer and enter them in to some half baked software online. As you go through the process, the dollar amount you owe/receive will swing wildly making you break into a sweaty mess. All of this is coupled with a stack of indecipherable rules handed down to you from some government entity responsible for the tax collection.</p><p>The entire mess with all the pre-tax and post-tax deductions, itemization, credits, and exemptions makes it incomprehensible if all you want to do is “pay your fair share”. Additionally, once a tax break is given, it’s very hard to take it back. Thus; we end up with 80,000 pages of IRS lawyer talk.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if at least you could take advantage of all these rules?</p><p>That’s why, I’m going to explore here the following question: <em>What is the maximum amount you can earn without paying any federal tax?</em></p><p>To keep this manageable, I will make a few assumptions. First, you’re filing as a married couple. This is purely out of convenience for me since that’s how I file. If you are filing as a single person, most of the time you can just divide the number in half. Additionally, there is a pile of rules I’ll ignore for convenience. They either don’t apply to the vast majority of people or are insignificant for the bottom line. Also, I will ignore Medicaid and Social security taxes. Finally, I will ignore any possible employer contributions or matches into your retirement accounts.</p><p>Let’s start by defining a few terms.</p><p><strong>Pre-tax </strong>(or traditional) — A type of deduction for which you don’t have to pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>Post-tax</strong> (or roth) — A type of deduction for which you do pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>401(k) — </strong>A retirement plan sponsored by your employer</p><p><strong>IRA — </strong>A retirement plan that you pay for yourself.</p><p><strong>Standard deduction — </strong>An amount every tax filer gets to deduct from their income to find their taxable income.</p><p><strong>Capital gains — </strong>The tax applied on an investment</p><p><em>Everything beyond will assume a pre-tax or traditional deduction. Roth deductions are for suckers. We will explore that next.</em></p><p>Now that we got the jargon out of the way, let’s see how we can apply it. We can start with the easiest. The standard deduction. It is $24,000 for a couple for the year 2018. If your family unit is bringing <strong><em>$24,000</em></strong> per year, the standard deduction would bring your taxable income down to $0. In turn, your taxes would be $0. Fantastic.</p><p>Next, you can contribute to a traditional IRA. The limits for traditional IRAs is $5500 per person or $11,000 per couple. Remember that a traditional IRA is a pre-tax deduction. Thus; you can earn an additional $11,000 per couple and pay $0 tax. We are now up to <strong><em>$35,000</em></strong>.</p><p>Similarly to IRA, you can also contribute to a traditional 401(k) program with your employer (if the employer is offering it). Each person has an IRS mandated limit of $18,500. Since you’re filing as a couple that gives you a total of $37,000 to deduct. Adding it to the above gives us a total of <strong><em>$72,000</em></strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>There’s one more easy pre-tax deduction left. The health savings account (HSA). This is a great choice for individuals with low medical expenses. Some highly respectable online individuals even describe it as the <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/\">ultimate savings account</a>. For 2018, the limit for a couple is $6,900. Adding that in to our total gives us <strong>$78,900</strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>In many cases, 401(k)’s and HSA’s come with a few more advantages. First, many employers are willing to match at least a part of your contributions. That usually amounts to a few thousand tax free dollars. Additionally, if you are 50 or older, 401(k)’s allow you to sock away another $6000 per individual. That’s another potential $12,000 to put away depending on your age.</p><p>Alright, we got all the obvious things out of the way. If you are not maximizing these, what are you waiting for?</p><p>Now let’s talk about the more esoteric options. First, there’s the 457(b). That’s a special program for government workers. If you are a teacher or a nurse or some other government worker you can usually participate in this plan. 457(b) plan has an interesting feature. Unlike other employer sponsored retirement plans, this option has a separate limit. That means you can contribute to both 401(k) and 457(b). Both also have the same limits. Therefore; if a couple works for the government, that’s an additional $37,000 that can be deducted. That would give you <strong>$115,900</strong> tax free dollars if my math is correct.</p><p>Of course this is not the Soviet Union. We don’t all work for the government. However, there is one other interesting way to reduce your taxes. If you went through my list of terms above, you may remember “capital gains”; the tax applied on investments. The great thing about this tax is that under certain conditions, when your investment “qualifies”, this tax can be 0 percent. You heard that right. You’ll pay nothing. The requirements are also relatively moderate. The main requirement is that your investment must be held for at least a year.</p><p>Once your investment is “qualified”, as long as you manage to keep your total <strong>taxable</strong> income to under $77,200, you’ll actually owe nothing to the government. Taxable is bolded on purpose. Remember that through the power of IRA’s, 401(k)’s and HSA’s we were able to earn $78,900 tax free. That’s because, for the purpose of taxation, you’ve earned $0. Now, if you were to earn an additional $77,200 from capital gains, that would still be taxed at 0 percent due to capital gains taxes. Amazing!</p><p>So what’s the bottom line?</p><p>As a couple with a decent job, you can earn <strong>$78,900</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the state or federal government, you can earn <strong>$115,900 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn an astonishing <strong>$193,100</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple above 50, working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn <strong>$205,100 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>There’s a huge array of further deductions and credits you can look into to reduce your taxes further. If you prefer, you can think of it as increasing your taxable income while keeping your tax obligation at zero. For example, the child tax credit can give you up to $2000.</p><p>However, most of us are not working for the government and do not have a portfolio that can generate $80,000 in capital gains year after year. Yet we can still reduce are taxable income by almost $79,000. To put that in perspective, the median income of a <strong><em>married</em></strong> household in 2016 was roughly $87,000; a little more then you can deduct.</p><p>I’m a strong proponent of saving hard and saving fast. That’s why, I encourage everyone to participate in any government money give away that is available to them within the legal boundaries. Retirement savings programs are “use it or lose” it programs. Make sure you use it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=737acc94778f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/most-money-you-can-earn-without-paying-a-dime-in-tax-737acc94778f\">Most money you can earn without paying a dime in tax</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I promised them a blog post was coming and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/make-it-rain-with-bitcoin-clickbait-218a528a85b1\">delivered it</a>. Since then, I’ve done some more reading about the concept and would like to clarify a few stances.</p><p>Before I do any clarification, I just want to say that I think the idea is actually very interesting. It is modeled after gold and assumes certain positions on the economy and prosperity. The libertarian in me definitely likes where this is going.</p><p>One error that I made when reading about Bitcoin was the assumption that all transactions are completely anonymous. I was under the impression that you can transfer money between two consenting adults and the government cannot politely place their noses in your business and ask for a cut. However, that’s not the case.</p><p>Either way, the idea of modeling it like gold is very intriguing. Every so often, when a conversation turns to money, someone looking to sound smart will state some sort of an opinion about how today’s money is “fiat currency” backed by nothing but thin air and promises. In the good old days, we had the gold standard so each dollar was worth something.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgKkfhi8Eaiw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href\">https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href</a></iframe><p>As the video above points out around the 50 second mark, the gold standard does not mean that money is backed by anything either. Gold is just a convenient way of figuring out who owns what and who owes who. It is like a ledger where we write down all the transactions.</p><blockquote>Gold isn’t valuable because we make jewellery out of it. It’s the other way around.</blockquote><p>As it turns out, good forms of money (such as gold) have 5 properties.</p><ol><li><strong>Scarcity — </strong>Gold is pretty hard to find</li><li><strong>Fungiability —</strong> Any gram of gold is equally valuable</li><li><strong>Divisibility —</strong> You can subdivide gold into smaller pieces to pay for cheaper things.</li><li><strong>Durability — </strong>Gold is a noble metal. Does not react under most extreme weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Transferability — </strong>Exchanging gold coins is reasonably easy and been done for thousands of years.</li></ol><p>Bitcoin meets all of the criteria above and some would argue exceeds these criteria relatively to gold. Does it mean it’s time to remortgage your house and go all in on Bitcoin mining like your Uber driver told you? Not quite. There’s 4 big problems that I see with the current state of crypto-currencies.</p><p><strong>It’s not an investment. </strong>The view that Bitcoin is an investment seems to be the most dangerous to me although it’s a widely held belief. To be fair, it’s hard to argue with results. If you held Bitcoin from 2010 to today you’d be a Zillionaire. Naturally, the typical precautions apply. “Past performance do not guarantee future results”.</p><p>However, I’m mostly referring to the word “investment”. I don’t think it should be used in this case. The reason is that an investment implies some sort of return due to added value. For example, you invest in stocks because you get to own a company that presumably adds value over time. Added value leads to bigger profits. Bigger profits lead to dividends and as a share holder you have a claim on those dividends. Similarly, we invest in real estate because we count on the rental income. We provide the valuable service of shelter and to thank us, the renter hands us dollars.</p><p>Where is the value being added when you store your dollars in the form of Bitcoin? There’s none actually. It’s just a commodity like gold. You may argue that it’s a store of value. You can make an argument that it’s a hedge against inflation (assuming it ever stabilizes in price). But there’s definitely no added value there so it’s not an investment.</p><p>And it isn’t just semantics. Something that is not an investment but you still risk money on to make more money sounds a lot like a gamble. I think that if everyone treated it like a gamble, the results wouldn’t be nearly as exciting. The pundits on TV would have to quiet down and the small talk at dinner will have to shift back to real estate (because that’s what we did before Bitcoin).</p><p><strong>Investors have no clue how it works. </strong>We were having a social gathering the other day. Once we were done talking about Trump for the night, the conversation obviously shifted to Bitcoin. Two of my friends wanted to know what I thought of the idea and if they should invest in it. We started talking about some fundamentals of money and investing when it dawned on me; I was standing next to two world class software engineers neither of whom understood how crypto-currencies worked. Neither did I. However, they were ready to put down thousands of dollars into this “investment”.</p><p>A week later I am chatting with another friend over coffee when he pulls out his phone to show me his portfolio. He has huge gains. Over 80% in just a month. Turns out he invested in 20 different crypto-currencies. However, when I asked him what percentage of the tech he understood, he admitted that it was roughly 0.5%. I appreciate the honesty but worried of the implications.</p><p>To be fair, this is anecdotal but I have a feeling it’s much more wide spread than many realize. Personally, I would never dream of investing in a company without ever knowing at least what they do and looking at some financial ratios. However, in this case, at least in some limited examples, it seems like the default approach is to buy now and figure it out later.</p><p><strong>It’s actually not that useful.</strong> This reason is most up for debate but I think it’s also going to be the most influential. For a currency to be of any use, it must be widely accepted. Bitcoin isn’t quite there yet. Some would argue that it’s just a matter of time until it’s adopted. However, I’m wondering why? Why would anyone actually use it?</p><p>I see one use case for me. I would like to be able to transfer money internationally without paying a middle man. Some people may like to buy guns and blow on the black market. Outside of that, I’m not really sure why it would be adopted. It makes moving money marginally better but adds a lot of barriers that need to be overcome.</p><p>What I’m really saying, is that beyond the hyper paranoid consumer and the mafia Don, there’s very little added value to Bitcoin as a currency. Therefore; I must wonder why it would gain any traction as a currency versus more established ones like the USD. I’m thinking about your average consumer. The ones that make up 95% of the population.</p><p><strong>It can easily be competed out of business. </strong>So there’s Bitcoin. There’s also Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Three weeks ago, I introduced SuckerCoin. In fact, as of this writing, there’s <strong>thousands</strong> of different crypto-currencies you can trade. Crypto-currencies are built on public ideas and open source technologies. There’s very little competitive advantage any one currency has that another cannot just adopt.</p><p>Bitcoin does have the advantage that is the first and best known. However, that could easily be erased over time as others gain (or Bitcoin loses). One option companies use to maintain their competitive advantage is to lobby the government for regulations and licensing to keep competitors out. I have a hard time imagining the Bitcoin lobby passing that through congress though.</p><p>The result is that anyone can start their own crypto-currency. Some of them have even real advantages. For example, Bitcoin has a limitation on how many transactions it can process in a 10 minute block. That is addressed in other currencies. Some currencies don’t even bother with that. They just jump on the hype train. After all, a rising tied lifts all boats.</p><p>If Bitcoin, or any other crypto-currency has any chance of staying around for the long term, it must be the currency that is accepted everywhere. But with thousands of currencies, how would anyone make the right choice? Of course, you could imagine a world where everyone accepts all crypto-currencies. However, in that case, the whole scarcity idea (property #1) becomes … questionable.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think that Bitcoin is a really cool idea. Getting central planning out of our money supply is a goal worth pursuing. Bitcoin should be thought of as version 1.0 of that idea. But just like all good software, we need to keep iterating over it.</p><p>Block-chain (the general idea behind all crypto-currencies) is great. I’m sure it will be widely adopted. Maybe even for our own financial system. Maybe by our governments. Who knows? However, I’m going to stick to the tried and true. I’m keeping my money in a well diversified passively managed index fund and I recommend you do the same. More on that later.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ds2XHyzPA9Zc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href\">https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href</a></iframe><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=375f566905b8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/elaborating-more-on-bitcoin-value-375f566905b8\">Elaborating more on Bitcoin value</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*UzWt816q3LL60RhL2VPK2A.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This is highly inspired by an article from Mr. Money Mustache titled <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/02/insurance-a-tax-on-people-who-are-bad-at-math/\">Insurance: A Tax on the stupid</a> and I found it to be quite influential for my way of thinking about insurance. The premise of the article is simple. Insure only the things you cannot afford to lose. Pay up for the rest because in the long run you’ll save money.</p><p>This makes perfect sense as well. Take any insurance company as an example. It exists for the sole purpose of making money. It does this by paying out less then it brings in. That means, the risk that it’s covering must cost less in the long run then what it charges for it in premiums. I think no one would argue against this idea.</p><p>Humans have two major flaws when it comes to losses. The first is that we seem to feel twice the amount of pain for a loss then an equivalent gain. Putting this in dollars is the easiest way. You’d feel twice as much pain for losing $100 then the pleasure of gaining $100. This is completely irrational but that’s just the way the mind works. It is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\">loss aversion</a>.</p><p>The second flaw is that we are really bad at estimating probabilities. Especially when these events are extremely unlikely. That’s why we have irrational fears about dying in a plane crash but aren’t worried what so ever about heart disease. Yet the former kills a tiny fraction of the latter.</p><p>So given these two flaws of human behaviour, we can now see why insurance becomes a bad deal. An insurance company knows roughly how likely houses are to burn down or your electronics getting damaged. With a large enough pool of people, they can calculate the risk reasonably well and then distribute it over many premium payers. In fact, since we over estimate the likelihood and the pain of loss, they can charge us significantly more for it.</p><p>The other issue I have with insurance is that people seem to insure absolutely everything of any moderate value. For example, people buy extended warranty on their TV’s and phones. They buy extended coverage on their cars. They insurance their pets. Etc. So what’s the problem?</p><blockquote>The problem is that it’s generally a big waste of money.</blockquote><p>Not only are you making money for the insurance companies but also it’s extremely silly to insure something you could afford to repurchase without thinking twice about it. If someone dents my car and I felt the need to fix it, I could pretty easily afford to do it and never think about it again. I wouldn’t bother going to the insurance company for it.</p><p>So the general rule of thumb is very simple. Buy insurance only if you cannot afford the replacement or the bills to fix it. For example, if my house burned down and I needed to rebuild it, I could not afford it. Thus; I insure my house. On the other hand, my deductible for my insurance is set to the maximum because I can afford to pay for it out of pocket.</p><p>And if you stop to think about the purpose of insurance, you’ll realize that is there to cover you in case of a catastrophic events. It is not there to save you $20. Dropping your flat screen TV on the floor is not a catastrophic event so buying extended insurance is plain dumb. Unless of course it is in which case buying a flat screen TV is plain dumb.</p><p>There’s one other situation that you can justify buying insurance for. It is very specific and you’re unlikely to run into but I feel I should mention it anyway. It is the time when you have some additional information that the insurance company doesn’t that significantly increases your risk. For example, let’s say you’re extremely shitty driver but you’re getting a great quote from GEICO. If you have a really good reason to believe that the insurance company is underestimating their risk significantly, go ahead and insure. But That’s unlikely to be true and the gain is probably not very significant.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=92da25663721\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">What to insure</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>That’s really a bit of a stretch and a click bait because this isn’t really my first intermittent fasting (IF) experience. This is however, a description of my first 24 hour IF experience. And it was quite glorious I must admit.</p><p>For those that don’t know, IF is pretty simple. You just don’t eat. You do this on purpose and you do it for a short period of time. Pretty much what it sounds like. IF’s can last from 12 hours to a week. There’s no official time limits really. Also, they obviously include things like water.</p><p>There’s plenty of evidence that IF is exceptionally healthy for you. For example, it seems to promote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy\">autophagy</a> (which in itself sounds like a great thing). It also helps you <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-and-weight-loss\">lose weight</a>. It can help you <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193152441400200X\">reverse type II diabetes</a>. Finally, it can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17291990/\">reduce inflammation</a> in the body which is responsible for many chronic diseases such are heart disease and Alzheimer’s.</p><p>I’ve read a lot of opinions about IF and many people recommend it as a regular practice. One such notable case is my internet hero, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@drjasonfung\">Dr. Jason Fung</a>. However, I’ve never done a longer fast then 16 hours. The way I would usually do it is have my dinner by 8 pm and then skip breakfast and have lunch the next day at around 12 pm. That makes it exactly 16 hours.That was pretty much my daily routine for the last year or so.</p><p>On Monday, I’ve decided to step it up a notch and see how I would feel if I went a full 24 hours. To do that, I had to skip one additional meal. Dinner had to go. I must admit that I was a little nervous at first. What if I get hungry? My brain would scream at me. I might even pass out from starvation (unlikely).</p><p>What really helped was that my wife was on board with this idea. In fact, like many of my great ideas, it was really her idea. And I wasn’t going to let her down. So like the good partner that I am, I had a huge lunch that day and went cold turkey. So far nothing special. There are a few more hours to dinner time.</p><p>Unfortunately, my wife changed her mind and decided that IF on that day was just not for her. So she decided to cook dinner. The sunken cost fallacy really kicked into high gear here and I just couldn’t give up. I went too far and wanted to try this so bad I figured I can manage without dinner. As a side note, I wasn’t even hungry come dinner time. But you know how it is when you see other people eat.</p><p>This was pretty much the hardest part of my experience. I’ve managed skip dinner while watching others eat. The rest was a total breeze. In the morning I had a black coffee and by lunch time I still wasn’t hungry. In fact it was amazing. I haven’t had a drop of food for 24 hours but my body wasn’t falling apart. It was a wonderful experience actually.</p><p>Now, an entire week has almost passed and I’m thinking back to Monday, I realize that this could definitely become a new habit of mine. And why not? It seems to be good for you. It makes perfect sense from an evolutionary points of view. My internet heroes are claiming it’s amazing. And it’s damn easy.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3a7cd7f7d229\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/first-intermittent-fasting-experience-3a7cd7f7d229\">First intermittent fasting experience</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Something clicked today that I should have realized much earlier. Nothing groundbreaking and earth shattering like my usual rants but still an interesting realization. I was always under the impression that each time I cheated and had an “improper” meal, I was breaking my diet and forcing my body to restart the entire process of fat adaptation.</p><p>Subconsciously, each time I had a bowl of rice at a restaurant or some sort of dessert that a friend baked, I thought to myself that it will be another few days to get back on track. On top of it, I fully expected to see it reflected on the scale and by the very scientific pinch test.</p><p>Nothing was further from reality. In fact, most of the time, I saw absolutely no change what so ever. Now, in hindsight, it is ridiculous to think that one bad meal or even one bad day could really cause any noticeable weight gain but there is also a slightly deeper insight. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.tuitnutrition.com/2016/01/dont-be-a-ketard1.html\">Amy Berger</a> I realized the difference between being fat adapted and being in ketosis. More importantly, I realized that just because you cheated, does not mean you’re suddenly not fat adapted.</p><p>Let’s start with an example. if you’re a typical SAD (standard American diet) consumer, eating tons of refined wheat flour, you are probably well tuned to convert glucose to energy. All the right enzymes are in place. This is your default mode and it seems to work okay for you. If you were to eat a meal high in fat but low in carbs at this point, you’d probably feel pretty cranky. Of course there’s an exact parallel to being tuned to eating and using fat for energy.</p><p>So what happens if you all of a sudden decide to cut the carbs from your high carb diet? Your body cannot get it’s energy nearly as efficiently anymore and it freaks out. It needs time to develop and express the enzymes related to oxidizing fat for energy. That helps explain why some people experience the so called “carb flu” when first switching to a low carb diet.</p><p>But my point is that this process is never an overnight event. It takes time to switch an adapt to a new form of energy. You are very likely to still be a fat burning machine the next day. Therefore; there’s worse things that you can do to your diet then once in a while having a bowl of rice.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2f4375142a09\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/worse-than-a-cheat-meal-2f4375142a09\">Worse than a cheat meal</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, my perfectionist wife has been setting up the room for a month prior to that. The possibility of someone giving us a three star rating is just too much to bear. Thankfully, we’ve been getting only five star ratings so far.</p><p>To ensure the five star rating keeps coming, we’ve had to go through each corner of the basement and clear it out, rearrange the furniture and fix any outstanding nagging maintenance issues. As a result, we’ve taken several trunk-loads of stuff straight to Goodwill — mostly random junk that was packed away in the basement, forgotten about and collecting dust.</p><p>The basement was also the place where our TV lived. We do not have another one upstairs. It is also the place where I kept my clothes. My wife graciously allowed me to keep my stuff in the basement while she took over the bedroom closet. It incorporated my own private bathroom as well. We’ve never had to worry where to keep my shaving paraphernalia versus her hair products.</p><p>Since we’ve started renting the basement, things had to change. We’ve shifted from having 1600 square feet to 900. My clothes moved upstairs. We’ve had to isolate a small corner in the closet for me. The bathrooms were unified (it is going through a clean up process as I am writing this). There’s also no more television.</p><blockquote>Essentially, we’ve forced ourselves into adopting a certain level of minimalism.</blockquote><p>Minimalism was never the intention when considering Airbnb. Instead, I was always thinking about our TTF (time to financial independence). That’s because Airbnb is the classic example of passivish income (I made that up). Your existing asset (the house) is doing most of the heavy lifting. You just need to remember to pay the bills. The more you automate, the more passive it becomes.</p><p>One glance around here and you’ll know right away that I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">minimalism</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/tagged/intentional-living\">intentional living</a>. That’s why it came to me as a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise when I realized I am forced to downsize substantially.</p><p>Before you jump to conclusions, this is not some personality disorder or twisted reasoning. I am not actively trying to induce self-harm. This is a very conscious decision. Ponder this idea of <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/\">happiness through subtraction</a> for example to see where I’m coming from. If you’re still not convinced, that’s fine. I’ll have a lot more to say about minimalism in the future.</p><p>In the mean time, for anyone thinking about their TTF, you should know there are some unintended consequences to Airbnb that go well beyond the money; intentional minimalism happens to be one of them.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=53c7a6122982\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">Surprising unintended consequences of Airbnb hosting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Of course there is. In one scenario you get to drive a brand new SUV to work with shiny new rims and an obnoxiously loud exhaust pipe, and the other you’re po’. I don’t think I need to explain which one is which. No one would dispute this.</p><p>However 😃, there is one important assumption we made. The assumption is that being po’ (that’s short for “poor” if someone is unclear) is bad and driving an SUV is good. In other words, we are talking about a basic, familiar consumer lifestyle. That is probably a fine assumption. Nonetheless, what if you’re an effai seeker? Apparently it’s <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5241566/vicki-robin-financial-independence-retire-early/\">all the rage with millennials</a>. You’d have to reconsider those assumptions.</p><p>The reason for this is very simple. If you are seeking effai, your goal isn’t to burn through as many resources as possible during your lifetime. Your goal is to get a <em>minimum amount of resources you need — and as early as possible</em>. That’s quite a different form of consumption.</p><p>So what gets you there sooner? By being “poor” you end up spending less money.</p><p>Spending less money means you require less money to live on.</p><p>Requiring less money to live on means you can save it up faster. That’s pretty simple math.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now return to the original question: Is a penny saved, as good as a penny earned? The answer to that is absolutely not. It’s far better.</p><p>Let’s take Hank and Lenny as an example (I have debated this with my friend Hank many times although I am somewhat misrepresenting his stance). For convenience, let’s also assume they have roughly the same standard of living costing $60k annually (or $5k monthly). They also save the same $3k per month. At that rate, and with some reasonable assumptions, it would take them about 16 years to reach effai (you can check for yourself <a href=\"https://effai.me/\">here</a>). If they started at 20 and keeping life circumstances constant, they’d reach effai at 36.</p><p>Turns out though, that Hank is also a very hard worker and got promoted recently. He also got a nice pay bump to go along with a fancier title and is now able to save an <strong>extra</strong> $1k a month. In other words, he is socking away $4k monthly instead of $3k. That brings his <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>T</strong>o e<strong>F</strong>fai (TTF 😃) down to 13.7 years from 16 — a savings of 2.3 years. Not bad!</p><p>Lenny on the other hand is a cheapskate. Instead of making more money, Lenny decided to cut his expenses by $1k (Let’s ignore the how for the sake of this article). What does that mean for Lenny? Since Lenny cut his expenses, he now lives on $4k a month instead of $5k. That puts effai 13 years away. That’s an additional 0.7 years sooner than Hank.</p><p><strong>Additionally</strong>, since Lenny cut his expenses, by $1k without changing anything else, he just freed up $1k to put towards <strong>savings</strong>. Lenny is now able to also save $4k per month just like Hank. This makes effai only 11 years away — a full 5 years earlier then originally anticipated.</p><p>In short, each penny you save, from an effai view, actually has two roles. First, it’s a penny you don’t have to produce with your passive income anymore. Second, it’s a penny you can redirect towards savings — Increasing significantly your savings rate.</p><blockquote>So, no, a penny saved is not a penny earned, it’s two!</blockquote><p>There is actually one other way to look at all of this. I find this to be far more impressive to think about than 11 years versus 13.7 years. Consider instead how much less money you actually need. For example, let’s go back to Lenny. He went from spending $5k to $4k and increased his savings from $3k to $4k.</p><p>Now take the 4% rule. Oh? You’re not familiar with it? I realize that I haven’t written about it yet. I’ll summarize it super quickly for the sake of this article:</p><blockquote>You can passively earn a dollar a month forever by intelligently investing $300.</blockquote><p>Now take the 4% rule. By cutting $1k a month from what Lenny spends, Lenny does not need to intelligently invest $300k. In other words, Lenny just saved himself from saving $300k.</p><p>This gets a tiny bit better actually. You should never think of your retirement number in today’s dollars. You always have to take inflation into account. The $300k we just saved for Lenny is in today’s dollars. Since Lenny is retiring in 11 years — and with an inflation rate of 2%, Lenny shaved off a whopping $373k off his retirement number. Cha-ching.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=32a31bf45d8a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">A penny saved is a penny earned.

We talked about all the different programs Uncle Sam offers to reduce our tax bill at the end of the year. There’s the traditional ones we hear about all the time like 401k’s and IRA. There’s a mention of a few less common ones as well. I encourage you to read it if you haven’t yet.</p><p>However, one of the most controversial options I mentioned was the Health Savings Account — also known as the HSA. Turns out, some people are not aware of all the super powers of the HSA and in turn ended up paying unnecessary taxes to the government. Thus; I’ve decided to break it down for you in a digestible way.</p><p>First, let’s talk about what HSA is used for. HSA is a savings account (I bet you didn’t see that coming) that allows you to save money for <strong>medical purposes</strong>. Each dollar that you set aside in an HSA is <strong>tax free. </strong>The money in the account can be invested in the stock market and grow tax free. Once you have a medical expense, the money can be withdrawn from the account, once again, tax free. You get the idea. One caveat is that HSA is only available for <strong>high deductible health plans.</strong></p><p>Of course, the government cannot allow you to put every single penny you earn towards medical expenses. There is a limit of $3,450 per person or $6,900 for a couple per year. That’s 2018 numbers.</p><p>Here’s a quick example of how it would work. Assume your household income for 2018 is $100,000. If you were to max out your HSA for you and your spouse, the government would tax you on $93,100 instead of the entire $100,000. That’s a free, ~$1500 you don’t have to pay in taxes!</p><p>Aside from federal income tax, there’s a few other taxes snuck into your pay stub. Two of them are social security and medicare — affectionately known as FICA. Together they add up to 7.65% of your income. Turns out, <strong>unlike</strong> <strong>all </strong>other retirement accounts available to you, HSA is the only one that is exempt from paying FICA taxes too. That’s another ~$500 in your deep pockets.</p><p>That’s just the beginning though. Once you’ve set aside the money in your HSA, the most powerful force in the universe takes over — compound interest. That’s because each dollar you’ve set aside can be invested and grow tax free. Naturally, as a FI (financial independence) pursuer, you’d invest it in a diversified index fund of stocks*. Over time, the growth alone could dominate any further contributions.</p><p>Let’s also address the elephant in the room. What do you do if you don’t need to spend all this money on health care? What if you’re healthy? Once again, you’re in luck. Aside from being healthy, once you hit 65, all the money saved up in your HSA can be used for <strong>anything </strong>penalty free. You heard that right; <strong>anything. </strong>Taxation is also simple. It is treated like regular income. In essence, your HSA becomes a traditional IRA. One exception is if HSA is used for medical purposes. In that case, withdrawals are still tax free.</p><p>This beast of Roth and Traditional IRA blended and fused together sounds like a great deal, doesn’t it? Should you then go ahead and switch your health plan at work to a high deductible plan as soon as possible? Probably.</p><p>However, there is one notable exception. If you tend to have high medical bills throughout the year, it doesn’t make much sense to switch to a higher deductible health plan. You could be better off forgoing the tax savings and letting the employer subsidize your health costs instead.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that some generous employers contribute to your HSA as well. It does count against your overall limit but free money is free money.</p><p>Finally, there’s always going to be a subset of people who are terrified of exposing themselves to a little bit more risk through the high deductible health plan. I suggest that you read my article addressing insurance in general appropriately named “<a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">what to insure</a>”. To summarize it in one sentence, I’d say, don’t worry about it if you can afford it.</p><p>*I need to write something an article, or more likely a series about stock investing for the FI pursuer.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ebdd3f35be8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/hsa-a-friend-on-the-road-to-financial-freedom-ebdd3f35be8\">HSA: a friend on the road to financial freedom</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

This time, you’ve automated the process further and you can now produce the same number of pins at a quarter of the previous time. By the same math, now you can work an hour a day and enjoy 7 hours of additional leisure. This is essentially the reality for our productivity curve between 1950’s and today. We are far more productive today by every measure. <em>However, the number of hours we work hasn’t budged.</em></p><p>The above was a prediction by a famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, in 1930. The video is a lecture by a professor in Economics trying to answer why this prediction did not materialize. The lecture is very insightful and brings up many interesting statistics about work, prosperity and well being broken down by gender, age and race. However, his main reason as to why the number of hours we work hasn’t decreased despite much progress in productivity is our love for work and money.</p><p>Although he presents good evidence to support his case, I believe there are a couple of other reasons we are working the same 40 hour weeks as we did in the 50’s that he overlooked. I would also argue that these reasons are equally important if not more so.</p><p><strong>The system isn’t conductive to less hours. </strong>Let’s go back to our pin maker from before. If the pin maker decided to lay back and enjoy the additional 7 hours of leisure, what do you think would happen? All of her competitors would eventually figure out the same new, faster method of production and flood the market with pins since they can now produce more — each trying to wrestle away market share. In turn, that would push prices down and our (lazy) pin maker would quickly go out of business. This is the basis of capitalism.</p><p>We can thank our high standard of living to this phenomena. It brought us many innovations by aligning incentives and pushed billions of people out of poverty all around the world. It does this by rewarding work and innovation but penalizing complacency.</p><p>However, there are certainly few employers out there that have toyed with the idea of lowering work hours. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/?utm_term=.f0094467d9cd\">Amazon considered introducing a 30 hour work week for some of their employees</a>.</p><p>If we have employers that are open to this idea, why don’t the employees rise up and demand lower work hours? Do we love money this much? I think there’s another more subtle reason that is driving it beyond greed.</p><p><strong>Most people haven’t discovered their purpose. </strong>If you ever needed to describe your purpose in life, could you? Not the purpose <strong>of</strong> life, that’s also beyond the scope of this article. Your purpose in life is what you’d like to achieve or do. If you can’t, that’s okay. Few people can.</p><p>Once you free up those 7 hours of leisure time, you must have a way to fill them up with some leisure activities. If you don’t have a purpose, it’s hard to come up with things to do unless traveling the world for 40 years sounds like a good idea to you; and there’s certainly <a href=\"https://www.gocurrycracker.com/\">people who think so</a>.</p><p>I’ve encountered this a lot when I talk to people about financial independence (FI or effai 😃). The question of what I would do with all that free time immediately comes up. This question sometimes stems from curiosity and other times to ridicule the idea (read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">article</a> for my thoughts on this behaviour). I’ve spoken to countless people about FI but only a handful ever considered what they would do if they had more time.</p><p>That’s why a job is usually the de facto source of purpose and the main occupier of time for most people. Once it’s taken away, people may feel lost. That’s also why <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-retirement-may-be-the-kiss-of-death-study-finds_us_57221aa3e4b01a5ebde49eff\">early retirees seem to die earlier</a>.</p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t even be considering FI if I believed dying early was an inevitable fact and no amount of salad eating could save me. Nor would I ever recommend it to anyone else. I believe that anyone who is working towards FI the traditional way — that is, by saving hard — must at some point consider their purpose. Otherwise they could not maintain the motivation to save so much for 15 plus years. That’s a tiny minority of people though.</p><p>Hence the result. Still working 100% of the time while creating 800% the product instead of working 1/8th of the time while producing 100% of the product.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eb73548c2121\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-real-reason-economic-progress-hasnt-lowered-work-hours-more-eb73548c2121\">The real reason economic progress hasn’t lowered work hours more</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I dread it because it’s that special time of the year. It’s the time you have to gather all those illegible slips you received from your employer and enter them in to some half baked software online. As you go through the process, the dollar amount you owe/receive will swing wildly making you break into a sweaty mess. All of this is coupled with a stack of indecipherable rules handed down to you from some government entity responsible for the tax collection.</p><p>The entire mess with all the pre-tax and post-tax deductions, itemization, credits, and exemptions makes it incomprehensible if all you want to do is “pay your fair share”. Additionally, once a tax break is given, it’s very hard to take it back. Thus; we end up with 80,000 pages of IRS lawyer talk.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if at least you could take advantage of all these rules?</p><p>That’s why, I’m going to explore here the following question: <em>What is the maximum amount you can earn without paying any federal tax?</em></p><p>To keep this manageable, I will make a few assumptions. First, you’re filing as a married couple. This is purely out of convenience for me since that’s how I file. If you are filing as a single person, most of the time you can just divide the number in half. Additionally, there is a pile of rules I’ll ignore for convenience. They either don’t apply to the vast majority of people or are insignificant for the bottom line. Also, I will ignore Medicaid and Social security taxes. Finally, I will ignore any possible employer contributions or matches into your retirement accounts.</p><p>Let’s start by defining a few terms.</p><p><strong>Pre-tax </strong>(or traditional) — A type of deduction for which you don’t have to pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>Post-tax</strong> (or roth) — A type of deduction for which you do pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>401(k) — </strong>A retirement plan sponsored by your employer</p><p><strong>IRA — </strong>A retirement plan that you pay for yourself.</p><p><strong>Standard deduction — </strong>An amount every tax filer gets to deduct from their income to find their taxable income.</p><p><strong>Capital gains — </strong>The tax applied on an investment</p><p><em>Everything beyond will assume a pre-tax or traditional deduction. Roth deductions are for suckers. We will explore that next.</em></p><p>Now that we got the jargon out of the way, let’s see how we can apply it. We can start with the easiest. The standard deduction. It is $24,000 for a couple for the year 2018. If your family unit is bringing <strong><em>$24,000</em></strong> per year, the standard deduction would bring your taxable income down to $0. In turn, your taxes would be $0. Fantastic.</p><p>Next, you can contribute to a traditional IRA. The limits for traditional IRAs is $5500 per person or $11,000 per couple. Remember that a traditional IRA is a pre-tax deduction. Thus; you can earn an additional $11,000 per couple and pay $0 tax. We are now up to <strong><em>$35,000</em></strong>.</p><p>Similarly to IRA, you can also contribute to a traditional 401(k) program with your employer (if the employer is offering it). Each person has an IRS mandated limit of $18,500. Since you’re filing as a couple that gives you a total of $37,000 to deduct. Adding it to the above gives us a total of <strong><em>$72,000</em></strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>There’s one more easy pre-tax deduction left. The health savings account (HSA). This is a great choice for individuals with low medical expenses. Some highly respectable online individuals even describe it as the <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/\">ultimate savings account</a>. For 2018, the limit for a couple is $6,900. Adding that in to our total gives us <strong>$78,900</strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>In many cases, 401(k)’s and HSA’s come with a few more advantages. First, many employers are willing to match at least a part of your contributions. That usually amounts to a few thousand tax free dollars. Additionally, if you are 50 or older, 401(k)’s allow you to sock away another $6000 per individual. That’s another potential $12,000 to put away depending on your age.</p><p>Alright, we got all the obvious things out of the way. If you are not maximizing these, what are you waiting for?</p><p>Now let’s talk about the more esoteric options. First, there’s the 457(b). That’s a special program for government workers. If you are a teacher or a nurse or some other government worker you can usually participate in this plan. 457(b) plan has an interesting feature. Unlike other employer sponsored retirement plans, this option has a separate limit. That means you can contribute to both 401(k) and 457(b). Both also have the same limits. Therefore; if a couple works for the government, that’s an additional $37,000 that can be deducted. That would give you <strong>$115,900</strong> tax free dollars if my math is correct.</p><p>Of course this is not the Soviet Union. We don’t all work for the government. However, there is one other interesting way to reduce your taxes. If you went through my list of terms above, you may remember “capital gains”; the tax applied on investments. The great thing about this tax is that under certain conditions, when your investment “qualifies”, this tax can be 0 percent. You heard that right. You’ll pay nothing. The requirements are also relatively moderate. The main requirement is that your investment must be held for at least a year.</p><p>Once your investment is “qualified”, as long as you manage to keep your total <strong>taxable</strong> income to under $77,200, you’ll actually owe nothing to the government. Taxable is bolded on purpose. Remember that through the power of IRA’s, 401(k)’s and HSA’s we were able to earn $78,900 tax free. That’s because, for the purpose of taxation, you’ve earned $0. Now, if you were to earn an additional $77,200 from capital gains, that would still be taxed at 0 percent due to capital gains taxes. Amazing!</p><p>So what’s the bottom line?</p><p>As a couple with a decent job, you can earn <strong>$78,900</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the state or federal government, you can earn <strong>$115,900 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn an astonishing <strong>$193,100</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple above 50, working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn <strong>$205,100 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>There’s a huge array of further deductions and credits you can look into to reduce your taxes further. If you prefer, you can think of it as increasing your taxable income while keeping your tax obligation at zero. For example, the child tax credit can give you up to $2000.</p><p>However, most of us are not working for the government and do not have a portfolio that can generate $80,000 in capital gains year after year. Yet we can still reduce are taxable income by almost $79,000. To put that in perspective, the median income of a <strong><em>married</em></strong> household in 2016 was roughly $87,000; a little more then you can deduct.</p><p>I’m a strong proponent of saving hard and saving fast. That’s why, I encourage everyone to participate in any government money give away that is available to them within the legal boundaries. Retirement savings programs are “use it or lose” it programs. Make sure you use it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=737acc94778f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/most-money-you-can-earn-without-paying-a-dime-in-tax-737acc94778f\">Most money you can earn without paying a dime in tax</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I promised them a blog post was coming and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/make-it-rain-with-bitcoin-clickbait-218a528a85b1\">delivered it</a>. Since then, I’ve done some more reading about the concept and would like to clarify a few stances.</p><p>Before I do any clarification, I just want to say that I think the idea is actually very interesting. It is modeled after gold and assumes certain positions on the economy and prosperity. The libertarian in me definitely likes where this is going.</p><p>One error that I made when reading about Bitcoin was the assumption that all transactions are completely anonymous. I was under the impression that you can transfer money between two consenting adults and the government cannot politely place their noses in your business and ask for a cut. However, that’s not the case.</p><p>Either way, the idea of modeling it like gold is very intriguing. Every so often, when a conversation turns to money, someone looking to sound smart will state some sort of an opinion about how today’s money is “fiat currency” backed by nothing but thin air and promises. In the good old days, we had the gold standard so each dollar was worth something.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgKkfhi8Eaiw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href\">https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href</a></iframe><p>As the video above points out around the 50 second mark, the gold standard does not mean that money is backed by anything either. Gold is just a convenient way of figuring out who owns what and who owes who. It is like a ledger where we write down all the transactions.</p><blockquote>Gold isn’t valuable because we make jewellery out of it. It’s the other way around.</blockquote><p>As it turns out, good forms of money (such as gold) have 5 properties.</p><ol><li><strong>Scarcity — </strong>Gold is pretty hard to find</li><li><strong>Fungiability —</strong> Any gram of gold is equally valuable</li><li><strong>Divisibility —</strong> You can subdivide gold into smaller pieces to pay for cheaper things.</li><li><strong>Durability — </strong>Gold is a noble metal. Does not react under most extreme weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Transferability — </strong>Exchanging gold coins is reasonably easy and been done for thousands of years.</li></ol><p>Bitcoin meets all of the criteria above and some would argue exceeds these criteria relatively to gold. Does it mean it’s time to remortgage your house and go all in on Bitcoin mining like your Uber driver told you? Not quite. There’s 4 big problems that I see with the current state of crypto-currencies.</p><p><strong>It’s not an investment. </strong>The view that Bitcoin is an investment seems to be the most dangerous to me although it’s a widely held belief. To be fair, it’s hard to argue with results. If you held Bitcoin from 2010 to today you’d be a Zillionaire. Naturally, the typical precautions apply. “Past performance do not guarantee future results”.</p><p>However, I’m mostly referring to the word “investment”. I don’t think it should be used in this case. The reason is that an investment implies some sort of return due to added value. For example, you invest in stocks because you get to own a company that presumably adds value over time. Added value leads to bigger profits. Bigger profits lead to dividends and as a share holder you have a claim on those dividends. Similarly, we invest in real estate because we count on the rental income. We provide the valuable service of shelter and to thank us, the renter hands us dollars.</p><p>Where is the value being added when you store your dollars in the form of Bitcoin? There’s none actually. It’s just a commodity like gold. You may argue that it’s a store of value. You can make an argument that it’s a hedge against inflation (assuming it ever stabilizes in price). But there’s definitely no added value there so it’s not an investment.</p><p>And it isn’t just semantics. Something that is not an investment but you still risk money on to make more money sounds a lot like a gamble. I think that if everyone treated it like a gamble, the results wouldn’t be nearly as exciting. The pundits on TV would have to quiet down and the small talk at dinner will have to shift back to real estate (because that’s what we did before Bitcoin).</p><p><strong>Investors have no clue how it works. </strong>We were having a social gathering the other day. Once we were done talking about Trump for the night, the conversation obviously shifted to Bitcoin. Two of my friends wanted to know what I thought of the idea and if they should invest in it. We started talking about some fundamentals of money and investing when it dawned on me; I was standing next to two world class software engineers neither of whom understood how crypto-currencies worked. Neither did I. However, they were ready to put down thousands of dollars into this “investment”.</p><p>A week later I am chatting with another friend over coffee when he pulls out his phone to show me his portfolio. He has huge gains. Over 80% in just a month. Turns out he invested in 20 different crypto-currencies. However, when I asked him what percentage of the tech he understood, he admitted that it was roughly 0.5%. I appreciate the honesty but worried of the implications.</p><p>To be fair, this is anecdotal but I have a feeling it’s much more wide spread than many realize. Personally, I would never dream of investing in a company without ever knowing at least what they do and looking at some financial ratios. However, in this case, at least in some limited examples, it seems like the default approach is to buy now and figure it out later.</p><p><strong>It’s actually not that useful.</strong> This reason is most up for debate but I think it’s also going to be the most influential. For a currency to be of any use, it must be widely accepted. Bitcoin isn’t quite there yet. Some would argue that it’s just a matter of time until it’s adopted. However, I’m wondering why? Why would anyone actually use it?</p><p>I see one use case for me. I would like to be able to transfer money internationally without paying a middle man. Some people may like to buy guns and blow on the black market. Outside of that, I’m not really sure why it would be adopted. It makes moving money marginally better but adds a lot of barriers that need to be overcome.</p><p>What I’m really saying, is that beyond the hyper paranoid consumer and the mafia Don, there’s very little added value to Bitcoin as a currency. Therefore; I must wonder why it would gain any traction as a currency versus more established ones like the USD. I’m thinking about your average consumer. The ones that make up 95% of the population.</p><p><strong>It can easily be competed out of business. </strong>So there’s Bitcoin. There’s also Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Three weeks ago, I introduced SuckerCoin. In fact, as of this writing, there’s <strong>thousands</strong> of different crypto-currencies you can trade. Crypto-currencies are built on public ideas and open source technologies. There’s very little competitive advantage any one currency has that another cannot just adopt.</p><p>Bitcoin does have the advantage that is the first and best known. However, that could easily be erased over time as others gain (or Bitcoin loses). One option companies use to maintain their competitive advantage is to lobby the government for regulations and licensing to keep competitors out. I have a hard time imagining the Bitcoin lobby passing that through congress though.</p><p>The result is that anyone can start their own crypto-currency. Some of them have even real advantages. For example, Bitcoin has a limitation on how many transactions it can process in a 10 minute block. That is addressed in other currencies. Some currencies don’t even bother with that. They just jump on the hype train. After all, a rising tied lifts all boats.</p><p>If Bitcoin, or any other crypto-currency has any chance of staying around for the long term, it must be the currency that is accepted everywhere. But with thousands of currencies, how would anyone make the right choice? Of course, you could imagine a world where everyone accepts all crypto-currencies. However, in that case, the whole scarcity idea (property #1) becomes … questionable.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think that Bitcoin is a really cool idea. Getting central planning out of our money supply is a goal worth pursuing. Bitcoin should be thought of as version 1.0 of that idea. But just like all good software, we need to keep iterating over it.</p><p>Block-chain (the general idea behind all crypto-currencies) is great. I’m sure it will be widely adopted. Maybe even for our own financial system. Maybe by our governments. Who knows? However, I’m going to stick to the tried and true. I’m keeping my money in a well diversified passively managed index fund and I recommend you do the same. More on that later.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ds2XHyzPA9Zc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href\">https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href</a></iframe><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=375f566905b8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/elaborating-more-on-bitcoin-value-375f566905b8\">Elaborating more on Bitcoin value</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*UzWt816q3LL60RhL2VPK2A.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This is highly inspired by an article from Mr. Money Mustache titled <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/02/insurance-a-tax-on-people-who-are-bad-at-math/\">Insurance: A Tax on the stupid</a> and I found it to be quite influential for my way of thinking about insurance. The premise of the article is simple. Insure only the things you cannot afford to lose. Pay up for the rest because in the long run you’ll save money.</p><p>This makes perfect sense as well. Take any insurance company as an example. It exists for the sole purpose of making money. It does this by paying out less then it brings in. That means, the risk that it’s covering must cost less in the long run then what it charges for it in premiums. I think no one would argue against this idea.</p><p>Humans have two major flaws when it comes to losses. The first is that we seem to feel twice the amount of pain for a loss then an equivalent gain. Putting this in dollars is the easiest way. You’d feel twice as much pain for losing $100 then the pleasure of gaining $100. This is completely irrational but that’s just the way the mind works. It is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\">loss aversion</a>.</p><p>The second flaw is that we are really bad at estimating probabilities. Especially when these events are extremely unlikely. That’s why we have irrational fears about dying in a plane crash but aren’t worried what so ever about heart disease. Yet the former kills a tiny fraction of the latter.</p><p>So given these two flaws of human behaviour, we can now see why insurance becomes a bad deal. An insurance company knows roughly how likely houses are to burn down or your electronics getting damaged. With a large enough pool of people, they can calculate the risk reasonably well and then distribute it over many premium payers. In fact, since we over estimate the likelihood and the pain of loss, they can charge us significantly more for it.</p><p>The other issue I have with insurance is that people seem to insure absolutely everything of any moderate value. For example, people buy extended warranty on their TV’s and phones. They buy extended coverage on their cars. They insurance their pets. Etc. So what’s the problem?</p><blockquote>The problem is that it’s generally a big waste of money.</blockquote><p>Not only are you making money for the insurance companies but also it’s extremely silly to insure something you could afford to repurchase without thinking twice about it. If someone dents my car and I felt the need to fix it, I could pretty easily afford to do it and never think about it again. I wouldn’t bother going to the insurance company for it.</p><p>So the general rule of thumb is very simple. Buy insurance only if you cannot afford the replacement or the bills to fix it. For example, if my house burned down and I needed to rebuild it, I could not afford it. Thus; I insure my house. On the other hand, my deductible for my insurance is set to the maximum because I can afford to pay for it out of pocket.</p><p>And if you stop to think about the purpose of insurance, you’ll realize that is there to cover you in case of a catastrophic events. It is not there to save you $20. Dropping your flat screen TV on the floor is not a catastrophic event so buying extended insurance is plain dumb. Unless of course it is in which case buying a flat screen TV is plain dumb.</p><p>There’s one other situation that you can justify buying insurance for. It is very specific and you’re unlikely to run into but I feel I should mention it anyway. It is the time when you have some additional information that the insurance company doesn’t that significantly increases your risk. For example, let’s say you’re extremely shitty driver but you’re getting a great quote from GEICO. If you have a really good reason to believe that the insurance company is underestimating their risk significantly, go ahead and insure. But That’s unlikely to be true and the gain is probably not very significant.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=92da25663721\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">What to insure</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Holding ESPPs is worse than I thought</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mejRoXmaep3EVw8O68BG9g.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This doesn’t happen very often.</p><p>I was corrected — on Twitter of all places. Turns out, my advice to you about selling ESPPs was spot on but my reasoning was wrong. I am here humbled in front of you and I stand corrected. Thank you <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/db5708d4ae24\">Tom Larson</a> for setting me straight.</p><p>Tax treatment for ESPPs is more complicated than I initially thought. My whole argument was <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-non-boring-advise-about-your-employee-stock-purchase-plan-3aa34f187cfb\">centered around the idea</a> that keeping the ESPP shares to pay long term capital gains tax was misguided because the savings are minuscule. The math is certainly impeccable. The tax treatment on the other hand is wrong.</p><p>Turns out, any discount given to you by your employer, is always taxed as regular income — regardless of how long you kept it for. That’s a bummer for Aaron.</p><p>It gets even nastier. My buddy Bob pointed another provision in the tax code. But first, a few definitions:</p><ol><li><strong>Offering period</strong>: the period of time the participant is locked in to a particular stock purchase plan; typically this is 12 months.</li><li><strong>Purchase period</strong>: the frequency in which you purchase stock within your <strong>offering period</strong>; typically this is 6 months (meaning there’s two purchase periods in a typical offering period).</li></ol><p>Great, now that we’re up to speed, let’s pretend your company stock doubled between the beginning of the offering period and the purchase date 6 months later. Here’s the kicker: to get a long term capital gains rate on the <strong>gain</strong> beyond the company discount, you must meet two criteria.</p><ol><li>Hold the shares for 12 months from the purchase date AND</li><li>Hold the shares for 24 months from the beginning of the offering period.</li></ol><p>That means, half the time you must hold your company stock for a full 18 months before you get to enjoy the lower tax rate.</p><p>To summarize for the skimmers: any discount given to you by the employer is <strong>always </strong>taxed as regular income. Any gain beyond that may be taxed as long term capital gains but the shares must be held for 24 months after offering period starts.</p><p>If the stock price went down between the offering date and the purchase date, the decisions becomes a complete no-brainer. Sell immediately. There is no advantages to be gained.</p><p>If the stock is up and you’re thinking of holding on to save a couple of bucks, consider these:</p><ol><li>Would you buy the stock today at the current price?</li><li>Are you willing to hold on for up to 18 months to save around 10% of your gains?</li></ol><p>If it’s a resounding yes to both questions, go ahead and wait. If any of them is a no, sell immediately; then go ahead and open up a <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager\">betterment</a> account.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=75562e090432\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/correction-holding-espps-is-worse-than-i-thought-75562e090432\">Correction.

I could plug in a few numbers into an online calculator and get a rough idea of when I could “retire”. After all, the principal is very simple. Mark your expenses on a graph. It should be a horizontal line with a slight upward slope to account for inflation. Plot your expected passive income each year. It should be a line with a steeper upward slope. Once those two lines intersect, congratulations, you are financially independent.</p><p>Figuring out your expenses is simple. Take your income. Subtract your savings. Whatever is left is your expenses.</p><p>How about your passive income? That’s easy as well. Take your net worth — all money you have invested. Apply the 4% rule (I have yet to write about it. You can Google it for now. In short, you can consider 4% of your net worth as passive income for the year). Done.</p><p>That’s all fine and dandy while you are living in your mom’s basement like I did. At some point though, you are likely to get your own place that comes with a mortgage and its own set of responsibilities. That’s when things get tricky. The fundamental idea doesn’t change. You still need to wait for the expenses curve to intersect with the passive income curve. The complexity is identifying those expenses.</p><p>While building <a href=\"https://effai.me\">Effai.me</a> I had to think long and hard about it because I just bought my own house. I was trying to see what kind of an effect it would have on my Effai date. After combing through the interwebs and researching through the available literature, the answer was… it depends. It depends on what you want to do. Turns out, you have three choices.</p><p><strong>Sell your house. </strong>Assuming the price of the house increases over time, you may find yourself at a point where selling your house could net you a big pile of money. That could significantly shorten your time to Effai. Once you sell it, the passive income you could generate would skyrocket.</p><p>How would you know if this is a good option for you? It’s a little more involved. You have to know several things.</p><ol><li>Your mortgage payments</li><li>Your home maintenance cost</li><li>Your property tax</li></ol><p>The sum of the three above is your <strong>housing cost</strong>. In addition, you’d need to know your new <strong>rental costs</strong>. That’s just one more number.</p><ol><li>The cost to rent something equivalent.</li></ol><p>When you sell, you bring your <strong>housing cost</strong> down to zero but introduce a new expense — <strong>rental costs</strong>. The two expenses are likely in the same ballpark and mostly cancel each other out. Selling your house and renting is usually your fastest way to Effai.</p><p>Of course, most people wouldn’t dream of ever going back to renting. After all, they’ve “left college years ago”. In that case, you are left with two other options.</p><p><strong>Pay off your mortgage. </strong>In a way, this is a mirror image of selling your house. Instead of putting money to work for you, you decide to reduce your expenses. This strategy will eliminate your monthly mortgage payment (Yay!!). However, you are still left with the maintenance bill and the always increasing property tax (Boo).</p><p>This could be a great strategy if you don’t have much debt left on your mortgage. A simple rule of thumb is this:</p><blockquote>If the mortgage payoff amount cannot generate more passive income than your monthly mortgage payments, go ahead and pay off your mortgage.</blockquote><p><strong>Don’t (or never) pay off your mortgage. </strong>You probably saw this one coming. If the rule above does not hold, this is for you. You are likely to find yourself in this situation if you bought the house recently and you still have a large amount of debt left. In that case, it may be cheaper for you to just keep your expenses as they are — mortgage payments included — and have your money passively pay for those expenses. This is a temporary solution since at some point you’ll have so little debt left you may want to pay it off. However, in the interest of retiring as early as possible this is definitely a possibility.</p><p>You’ll be glad to know that <a href=\"https://effai.me\">Effai.me</a> runs all three of these scenarios for you. It is very biased towards retiring early. I hope the above made sense. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need some clarifications.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6b5f4ab853e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/will-purchasing-a-home-help-or-hurt-financial-independence-6b5f4ab853e\">Will purchasing a home help or hurt financial independence?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It is honestly one of my favorite past time activities. On the surface, it is a very simple concept. Save a bunch of money. Keep going until you supplement your living expenses. Conversation over, right? Wrong. Turns out, there’s a lot more to it.</p><p>I ended up having an interesting discussion recently with my colleagues Troy and Nina over beer (all good conversations involve beer). The question we deliberated was this:</p><blockquote>Why do we leave retirement to the end?</blockquote><p>If you’re in the traditional mindset of retiring at 65, this might seem like an odd question. How else would you have it? On the other hand, If you’ve discovered the wonderful world of financial independence, it’s a perfectly fair question. Why do we leave it to the end?</p><p>The end can certainly be very long. You can stay retired for 60 years. But it still comes after continuous chunk of work.</p><p>So what’s the alternative? One option is to take 6 months off right now. Do your thing. Then come back and work some more.</p><p>This actually has a great benefit. You get to discover what it’s like to be financially independent without having to wait for years for your savings to accumulate. It’s like shopping at Costco without membership. Fantastic!</p><p>The first time I heard about this concept was back around 2011 when I read <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/56d3bc91794f\">Tim Ferriss</a>’s 4 hour work week. In the book he talks about having mini retirements throughout your working life. I thought the idea was profound. It definitely changed the way I viewed retirement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week\">The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</a></p><p>Except there’s a problem. Lunches aren’t free. In this case, it’s your <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">TTF</a> (Time To Financial independence). If you are taking time off work to travel and “find yourself”, you’re not earning any money. If you’re doing it for 6 months, you just set yourself back by 6 months.</p><p>It gets worse. Since you are unable to perform photosynthesis, you also end up spending money. Your TTF moves back by an additional number of months it would take you to save what you’ve just spent. It can be summarized as follows:</p><blockquote>Your TTF moves forward by the amount you save and moves back by the amount you earn.</blockquote><p>You save less than 100% of what you earn. Hence, it will take you longer to make up the hole in your savings than the time you took off.</p><p>There’s a second downside to the concept of mini-retirements. People seeking financial independence (effai seekers) tend to fall in one of two (or both) camps.</p><ul><li>You are looking for <strong>freedom </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the work schedules.</li><li>You are looking for <strong>security </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the business cycle.</li></ul><p>Mini-retirements address the freedom part at the expense of security part.</p><p>Imagine you’re a technology worker in 1999. You decide you’re burned out. You’d like to take 6 months off and travel to Thailand. Great! except when you come back, there’s no job waiting for you. It’s likely you won’t have another one for a while. Once you do get one, it’s going to be half the salary.</p><p>None of this means you can’t be financially independent but recessions and economic downturns are things most people want to avoid. One such way is financial independence.</p><p>Does this mean my professional opinion is that mini-retirements are a bad idea? Absolutely not.</p><p>You could mitigate the downsides by taking less time off. 3 months might suffice to find who you really are. The damage to your TTF is eased and your employer might even agree to keep your position open for you. Just be aware of the risks. I have been always too scared to take the time off.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aa52c4c59f8b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-do-we-leave-retirement-to-the-end-aa52c4c59f8b\">Why do we leave retirement to the end?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Of course there is. In one scenario you get to drive a brand new SUV to work with shiny new rims and an obnoxiously loud exhaust pipe, and the other you’re po’. I don’t think I need to explain which one is which. No one would dispute this.</p><p>However 😃, there is one important assumption we made. The assumption is that being po’ (that’s short for “poor” if someone is unclear) is bad and driving an SUV is good. In other words, we are talking about a basic, familiar consumer lifestyle. That is probably a fine assumption. Nonetheless, what if you’re an effai seeker? Apparently it’s <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5241566/vicki-robin-financial-independence-retire-early/\">all the rage with millennials</a>. You’d have to reconsider those assumptions.</p><p>The reason for this is very simple. If you are seeking effai, your goal isn’t to burn through as many resources as possible during your lifetime. Your goal is to get a <em>minimum amount of resources you need — and as early as possible</em>. That’s quite a different form of consumption.</p><p>So what gets you there sooner? By being “poor” you end up spending less money.</p><p>Spending less money means you require less money to live on.</p><p>Requiring less money to live on means you can save it up faster. That’s pretty simple math.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now return to the original question: Is a penny saved, as good as a penny earned? The answer to that is absolutely not. It’s far better.</p><p>Let’s take Hank and Lenny as an example (I have debated this with my friend Hank many times although I am somewhat misrepresenting his stance). For convenience, let’s also assume they have roughly the same standard of living costing $60k annually (or $5k monthly). They also save the same $3k per month. At that rate, and with some reasonable assumptions, it would take them about 16 years to reach effai (you can check for yourself <a href=\"https://effai.me/\">here</a>). If they started at 20 and keeping life circumstances constant, they’d reach effai at 36.</p><p>Turns out though, that Hank is also a very hard worker and got promoted recently. He also got a nice pay bump to go along with a fancier title and is now able to save an <strong>extra</strong> $1k a month. In other words, he is socking away $4k monthly instead of $3k. That brings his <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>T</strong>o e<strong>F</strong>fai (TTF 😃) down to 13.7 years from 16 — a savings of 2.3 years. Not bad!</p><p>Lenny on the other hand is a cheapskate. Instead of making more money, Lenny decided to cut his expenses by $1k (Let’s ignore the how for the sake of this article). What does that mean for Lenny? Since Lenny cut his expenses, he now lives on $4k a month instead of $5k. That puts effai 13 years away. That’s an additional 0.7 years sooner than Hank.</p><p><strong>Additionally</strong>, since Lenny cut his expenses, by $1k without changing anything else, he just freed up $1k to put towards <strong>savings</strong>. Lenny is now able to also save $4k per month just like Hank. This makes effai only 11 years away — a full 5 years earlier then originally anticipated.</p><p>In short, each penny you save, from an effai view, actually has two roles. First, it’s a penny you don’t have to produce with your passive income anymore. Second, it’s a penny you can redirect towards savings — Increasing significantly your savings rate.</p><blockquote>So, no, a penny saved is not a penny earned, it’s two!</blockquote><p>There is actually one other way to look at all of this. I find this to be far more impressive to think about than 11 years versus 13.7 years. Consider instead how much less money you actually need. For example, let’s go back to Lenny. He went from spending $5k to $4k and increased his savings from $3k to $4k.</p><p>Now take the 4% rule. Oh? You’re not familiar with it? I realize that I haven’t written about it yet. I’ll summarize it super quickly for the sake of this article:</p><blockquote>You can passively earn a dollar a month forever by intelligently investing $300.</blockquote><p>Now take the 4% rule. By cutting $1k a month from what Lenny spends, Lenny does not need to intelligently invest $300k. In other words, Lenny just saved himself from saving $300k.</p><p>This gets a tiny bit better actually. You should never think of your retirement number in today’s dollars. You always have to take inflation into account. The $300k we just saved for Lenny is in today’s dollars. Since Lenny is retiring in 11 years — and with an inflation rate of 2%, Lenny shaved off a whopping $373k off his retirement number. Cha-ching.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=32a31bf45d8a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">A penny saved is a penny earned.

We weren’t sure what it was. So what do we do? We Google it of course. Now we’re really scared. It’s the last thing you want to read about. It could be the big C. Based on my cat’s age, and the description online it is also somewhat likely.</p><p>We go ahead and yelp the closest good vet in the neighborhood and schedule a prompt appointment for the next day. I took the kitty in and sat there anxiously as the vet inspected her carefully. Eventually she informed me she doesn’t really know what it is exactly and we’ll need to do a biopsy. Great… :-s</p><p>One thing she did recommend is to do an x-ray to make sure that if it is cancer, it didn’t spread to the lungs. If it did, there wasn’t much to treat there. Also, she was missing a couple of shots that the city enforced by law. I obliged and we went ahead with the procedure and the shots.</p><p>I sat through and waited patiently for the results to come back. Luckily, there was no sign of cancer in the lungs. A big relief to say the least. As I get ready to walk out I’m also reminded that I have to pay. They hand me a bill and ask me to go to the front desk and settle it. I open it to see the total damage. It’s well over $700. That’s just for today. The biopsy estimate is another $500.</p><p>Now don’t get me wrong. I’ll gladly pay that and much more as long as my kitty is healthy. But not everyone is able to pay $1200 and keep the lights on. For some people, that’s a very significant amount of money. Some people may need to choose between paying the vet bill and rent.</p><p>My first hint regarding the cost of treatment should have been all the posters advertising financing options. I remember looking at them and then chuckling in my mind about the absurd idea of financing bills in general. How irresponsible!</p><p>Before you start explaining to me the free market I just want to say this isn’t some cry baby, socialist plea to nationalize veterinarian treatment. I picked the best vet in the area and agreed to all the pricing ahead of time. But there was one huge thing that dawned on me that day. Something that I never truly understood until that day.</p><blockquote>The reason why money is great is not because of all the consumables you can obtain but because of the security it offers you.</blockquote><p>I swiped my credit card and walked out of that vet high as a kite thinking only about the fact that my cat didn’t have cancer that metastasized. That’s all I cared about. The $1200 I just paid will be paid off the next day and I’ll never worry about it again. That’s a very privileged but little appreciated place to be in.</p><p>I guess I understood this idea subconsciously. After all, the entire idea of being FI (financially independent) is financial security. You save enough money to be “employer independent”. It’s something I’ve been working towards for nearly a decade. But never in my life did I understand how important it is until that day.</p><p>A lot of people concentrate on the idea of not working. At least not the traditional way for some big corporation in a soul sucking cubicle job. I admit that this idea is very attractive but it’s the cherry at the top. The real benefit of FI is the security that comes with it. It’s the knowledge that no matter what, your bills will be taken care of.</p><p>You are recession proof for life. You are interest rates, stock market, bond market, and job market independent. On top of it all, life tends to throw curve balls. Those curves could in many cases improve your state. It could be a raise, a move to a different city or country or a new more lucrative job offer. Occasionally it could also be a broken transmission. Either way, you got it covered and you can sleep at night just fine. Great feeling in my mind.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6d70e5c1b9dc\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-its-good-to-be-rich-6d70e5c1b9dc\">Why it’s good to be rich</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, my perfectionist wife has been setting up the room for a month prior to that. The possibility of someone giving us a three star rating is just too much to bear. Thankfully, we’ve been getting only five star ratings so far.</p><p>To ensure the five star rating keeps coming, we’ve had to go through each corner of the basement and clear it out, rearrange the furniture and fix any outstanding nagging maintenance issues. As a result, we’ve taken several trunk-loads of stuff straight to Goodwill — mostly random junk that was packed away in the basement, forgotten about and collecting dust.</p><p>The basement was also the place where our TV lived. We do not have another one upstairs. It is also the place where I kept my clothes. My wife graciously allowed me to keep my stuff in the basement while she took over the bedroom closet. It incorporated my own private bathroom as well. We’ve never had to worry where to keep my shaving paraphernalia versus her hair products.</p><p>Since we’ve started renting the basement, things had to change. We’ve shifted from having 1600 square feet to 900. My clothes moved upstairs. We’ve had to isolate a small corner in the closet for me. The bathrooms were unified (it is going through a clean up process as I am writing this). There’s also no more television.</p><blockquote>Essentially, we’ve forced ourselves into adopting a certain level of minimalism.</blockquote><p>Minimalism was never the intention when considering Airbnb. Instead, I was always thinking about our TTF (time to financial independence). That’s because Airbnb is the classic example of passivish income (I made that up). Your existing asset (the house) is doing most of the heavy lifting. You just need to remember to pay the bills. The more you automate, the more passive it becomes.</p><p>One glance around here and you’ll know right away that I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">minimalism</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/tagged/intentional-living\">intentional living</a>. That’s why it came to me as a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise when I realized I am forced to downsize substantially.</p><p>Before you jump to conclusions, this is not some personality disorder or twisted reasoning. I am not actively trying to induce self-harm. This is a very conscious decision. Ponder this idea of <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/\">happiness through subtraction</a> for example to see where I’m coming from. If you’re still not convinced, that’s fine. I’ll have a lot more to say about minimalism in the future.</p><p>In the mean time, for anyone thinking about their TTF, you should know there are some unintended consequences to Airbnb that go well beyond the money; intentional minimalism happens to be one of them.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=53c7a6122982\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">Surprising unintended consequences of Airbnb hosting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Of course there is. In one scenario you get to drive a brand new SUV to work with shiny new rims and an obnoxiously loud exhaust pipe, and the other you’re po’. I don’t think I need to explain which one is which. No one would dispute this.</p><p>However 😃, there is one important assumption we made. The assumption is that being po’ (that’s short for “poor” if someone is unclear) is bad and driving an SUV is good. In other words, we are talking about a basic, familiar consumer lifestyle. That is probably a fine assumption. Nonetheless, what if you’re an effai seeker? Apparently it’s <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5241566/vicki-robin-financial-independence-retire-early/\">all the rage with millennials</a>. You’d have to reconsider those assumptions.</p><p>The reason for this is very simple. If you are seeking effai, your goal isn’t to burn through as many resources as possible during your lifetime. Your goal is to get a <em>minimum amount of resources you need — and as early as possible</em>. That’s quite a different form of consumption.</p><p>So what gets you there sooner? By being “poor” you end up spending less money.</p><p>Spending less money means you require less money to live on.</p><p>Requiring less money to live on means you can save it up faster. That’s pretty simple math.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now return to the original question: Is a penny saved, as good as a penny earned? The answer to that is absolutely not. It’s far better.</p><p>Let’s take Hank and Lenny as an example (I have debated this with my friend Hank many times although I am somewhat misrepresenting his stance). For convenience, let’s also assume they have roughly the same standard of living costing $60k annually (or $5k monthly). They also save the same $3k per month. At that rate, and with some reasonable assumptions, it would take them about 16 years to reach effai (you can check for yourself <a href=\"https://effai.me/\">here</a>). If they started at 20 and keeping life circumstances constant, they’d reach effai at 36.</p><p>Turns out though, that Hank is also a very hard worker and got promoted recently. He also got a nice pay bump to go along with a fancier title and is now able to save an <strong>extra</strong> $1k a month. In other words, he is socking away $4k monthly instead of $3k. That brings his <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>T</strong>o e<strong>F</strong>fai (TTF 😃) down to 13.7 years from 16 — a savings of 2.3 years. Not bad!</p><p>Lenny on the other hand is a cheapskate. Instead of making more money, Lenny decided to cut his expenses by $1k (Let’s ignore the how for the sake of this article). What does that mean for Lenny? Since Lenny cut his expenses, he now lives on $4k a month instead of $5k. That puts effai 13 years away. That’s an additional 0.7 years sooner than Hank.</p><p><strong>Additionally</strong>, since Lenny cut his expenses, by $1k without changing anything else, he just freed up $1k to put towards <strong>savings</strong>. Lenny is now able to also save $4k per month just like Hank. This makes effai only 11 years away — a full 5 years earlier then originally anticipated.</p><p>In short, each penny you save, from an effai view, actually has two roles. First, it’s a penny you don’t have to produce with your passive income anymore. Second, it’s a penny you can redirect towards savings — Increasing significantly your savings rate.</p><blockquote>So, no, a penny saved is not a penny earned, it’s two!</blockquote><p>There is actually one other way to look at all of this. I find this to be far more impressive to think about than 11 years versus 13.7 years. Consider instead how much less money you actually need. For example, let’s go back to Lenny. He went from spending $5k to $4k and increased his savings from $3k to $4k.</p><p>Now take the 4% rule. Oh? You’re not familiar with it? I realize that I haven’t written about it yet. I’ll summarize it super quickly for the sake of this article:</p><blockquote>You can passively earn a dollar a month forever by intelligently investing $300.</blockquote><p>Now take the 4% rule. By cutting $1k a month from what Lenny spends, Lenny does not need to intelligently invest $300k. In other words, Lenny just saved himself from saving $300k.</p><p>This gets a tiny bit better actually. You should never think of your retirement number in today’s dollars. You always have to take inflation into account. The $300k we just saved for Lenny is in today’s dollars. Since Lenny is retiring in 11 years — and with an inflation rate of 2%, Lenny shaved off a whopping $373k off his retirement number. Cha-ching.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=32a31bf45d8a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">A penny saved is a penny earned.

We talked about all the different programs Uncle Sam offers to reduce our tax bill at the end of the year. There’s the traditional ones we hear about all the time like 401k’s and IRA. There’s a mention of a few less common ones as well. I encourage you to read it if you haven’t yet.</p><p>However, one of the most controversial options I mentioned was the Health Savings Account — also known as the HSA. Turns out, some people are not aware of all the super powers of the HSA and in turn ended up paying unnecessary taxes to the government. Thus; I’ve decided to break it down for you in a digestible way.</p><p>First, let’s talk about what HSA is used for. HSA is a savings account (I bet you didn’t see that coming) that allows you to save money for <strong>medical purposes</strong>. Each dollar that you set aside in an HSA is <strong>tax free. </strong>The money in the account can be invested in the stock market and grow tax free. Once you have a medical expense, the money can be withdrawn from the account, once again, tax free. You get the idea. One caveat is that HSA is only available for <strong>high deductible health plans.</strong></p><p>Of course, the government cannot allow you to put every single penny you earn towards medical expenses. There is a limit of $3,450 per person or $6,900 for a couple per year. That’s 2018 numbers.</p><p>Here’s a quick example of how it would work. Assume your household income for 2018 is $100,000. If you were to max out your HSA for you and your spouse, the government would tax you on $93,100 instead of the entire $100,000. That’s a free, ~$1500 you don’t have to pay in taxes!</p><p>Aside from federal income tax, there’s a few other taxes snuck into your pay stub. Two of them are social security and medicare — affectionately known as FICA. Together they add up to 7.65% of your income. Turns out, <strong>unlike</strong> <strong>all </strong>other retirement accounts available to you, HSA is the only one that is exempt from paying FICA taxes too. That’s another ~$500 in your deep pockets.</p><p>That’s just the beginning though. Once you’ve set aside the money in your HSA, the most powerful force in the universe takes over — compound interest. That’s because each dollar you’ve set aside can be invested and grow tax free. Naturally, as a FI (financial independence) pursuer, you’d invest it in a diversified index fund of stocks*. Over time, the growth alone could dominate any further contributions.</p><p>Let’s also address the elephant in the room. What do you do if you don’t need to spend all this money on health care? What if you’re healthy? Once again, you’re in luck. Aside from being healthy, once you hit 65, all the money saved up in your HSA can be used for <strong>anything </strong>penalty free. You heard that right; <strong>anything. </strong>Taxation is also simple. It is treated like regular income. In essence, your HSA becomes a traditional IRA. One exception is if HSA is used for medical purposes. In that case, withdrawals are still tax free.</p><p>This beast of Roth and Traditional IRA blended and fused together sounds like a great deal, doesn’t it? Should you then go ahead and switch your health plan at work to a high deductible plan as soon as possible? Probably.</p><p>However, there is one notable exception. If you tend to have high medical bills throughout the year, it doesn’t make much sense to switch to a higher deductible health plan. You could be better off forgoing the tax savings and letting the employer subsidize your health costs instead.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that some generous employers contribute to your HSA as well. It does count against your overall limit but free money is free money.</p><p>Finally, there’s always going to be a subset of people who are terrified of exposing themselves to a little bit more risk through the high deductible health plan. I suggest that you read my article addressing insurance in general appropriately named “<a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">what to insure</a>”. To summarize it in one sentence, I’d say, don’t worry about it if you can afford it.</p><p>*I need to write something an article, or more likely a series about stock investing for the FI pursuer.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ebdd3f35be8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/hsa-a-friend-on-the-road-to-financial-freedom-ebdd3f35be8\">HSA: a friend on the road to financial freedom</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

If you are working the standard North American schedule, it would translate to 40 hours a week or 8 hours a day. Now imagine that through some innovation on your part, you are now able to produce the same number of pins at half the time. To satisfy the same demand you can now work only 4 hours a day and enjoy an additional 4 hours of leisure. Straightforward math so far.</p><p>Let’s take this a step further. This time, you’ve automated the process further and you can now produce the same number of pins at a quarter of the previous time. By the same math, now you can work an hour a day and enjoy 7 hours of additional leisure. This is essentially the reality for our productivity curve between 1950’s and today. We are far more productive today by every measure. <em>However, the number of hours we work hasn’t budged.</em></p><p>The above was a prediction by a famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, in 1930. The video is a lecture by a professor in Economics trying to answer why this prediction did not materialize. The lecture is very insightful and brings up many interesting statistics about work, prosperity and well being broken down by gender, age and race. However, his main reason as to why the number of hours we work hasn’t decreased despite much progress in productivity is our love for work and money.</p><p>Although he presents good evidence to support his case, I believe there are a couple of other reasons we are working the same 40 hour weeks as we did in the 50’s that he overlooked. I would also argue that these reasons are equally important if not more so.</p><p><strong>The system isn’t conductive to less hours. </strong>Let’s go back to our pin maker from before. If the pin maker decided to lay back and enjoy the additional 7 hours of leisure, what do you think would happen? All of her competitors would eventually figure out the same new, faster method of production and flood the market with pins since they can now produce more — each trying to wrestle away market share. In turn, that would push prices down and our (lazy) pin maker would quickly go out of business. This is the basis of capitalism.</p><p>We can thank our high standard of living to this phenomena. It brought us many innovations by aligning incentives and pushed billions of people out of poverty all around the world. It does this by rewarding work and innovation but penalizing complacency.</p><p>However, there are certainly few employers out there that have toyed with the idea of lowering work hours. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/?utm_term=.f0094467d9cd\">Amazon considered introducing a 30 hour work week for some of their employees</a>.</p><p>If we have employers that are open to this idea, why don’t the employees rise up and demand lower work hours? Do we love money this much? I think there’s another more subtle reason that is driving it beyond greed.</p><p><strong>Most people haven’t discovered their purpose. </strong>If you ever needed to describe your purpose in life, could you? Not the purpose <strong>of</strong> life, that’s also beyond the scope of this article. Your purpose in life is what you’d like to achieve or do. If you can’t, that’s okay. Few people can.</p><p>Once you free up those 7 hours of leisure time, you must have a way to fill them up with some leisure activities. If you don’t have a purpose, it’s hard to come up with things to do unless traveling the world for 40 years sounds like a good idea to you; and there’s certainly <a href=\"https://www.gocurrycracker.com/\">people who think so</a>.</p><p>I’ve encountered this a lot when I talk to people about financial independence (FI or effai 😃). The question of what I would do with all that free time immediately comes up. This question sometimes stems from curiosity and other times to ridicule the idea (read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">article</a> for my thoughts on this behaviour). I’ve spoken to countless people about FI but only a handful ever considered what they would do if they had more time.</p><p>That’s why a job is usually the de facto source of purpose and the main occupier of time for most people. Once it’s taken away, people may feel lost. That’s also why <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-retirement-may-be-the-kiss-of-death-study-finds_us_57221aa3e4b01a5ebde49eff\">early retirees seem to die earlier</a>.</p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t even be considering FI if I believed dying early was an inevitable fact and no amount of salad eating could save me. Nor would I ever recommend it to anyone else. I believe that anyone who is working towards FI the traditional way — that is, by saving hard — must at some point consider their purpose. Otherwise they could not maintain the motivation to save so much for 15 plus years. That’s a tiny minority of people though.</p><p>Hence the result. Still working 100% of the time while creating 800% the product instead of working 1/8th of the time while producing 100% of the product.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eb73548c2121\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-real-reason-economic-progress-hasnt-lowered-work-hours-more-eb73548c2121\">The real reason economic progress hasn’t lowered work hours more</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I dread it because it’s that special time of the year. It’s the time you have to gather all those illegible slips you received from your employer and enter them in to some half baked software online. As you go through the process, the dollar amount you owe/receive will swing wildly making you break into a sweaty mess. All of this is coupled with a stack of indecipherable rules handed down to you from some government entity responsible for the tax collection.</p><p>The entire mess with all the pre-tax and post-tax deductions, itemization, credits, and exemptions makes it incomprehensible if all you want to do is “pay your fair share”. Additionally, once a tax break is given, it’s very hard to take it back. Thus; we end up with 80,000 pages of IRS lawyer talk.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if at least you could take advantage of all these rules?</p><p>That’s why, I’m going to explore here the following question: <em>What is the maximum amount you can earn without paying any federal tax?</em></p><p>To keep this manageable, I will make a few assumptions. First, you’re filing as a married couple. This is purely out of convenience for me since that’s how I file. If you are filing as a single person, most of the time you can just divide the number in half. Additionally, there is a pile of rules I’ll ignore for convenience. They either don’t apply to the vast majority of people or are insignificant for the bottom line. Also, I will ignore Medicaid and Social security taxes. Finally, I will ignore any possible employer contributions or matches into your retirement accounts.</p><p>Let’s start by defining a few terms.</p><p><strong>Pre-tax </strong>(or traditional) — A type of deduction for which you don’t have to pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>Post-tax</strong> (or roth) — A type of deduction for which you do pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>401(k) — </strong>A retirement plan sponsored by your employer</p><p><strong>IRA — </strong>A retirement plan that you pay for yourself.</p><p><strong>Standard deduction — </strong>An amount every tax filer gets to deduct from their income to find their taxable income.</p><p><strong>Capital gains — </strong>The tax applied on an investment</p><p><em>Everything beyond will assume a pre-tax or traditional deduction. Roth deductions are for suckers. We will explore that next.</em></p><p>Now that we got the jargon out of the way, let’s see how we can apply it. We can start with the easiest. The standard deduction. It is $24,000 for a couple for the year 2018. If your family unit is bringing <strong><em>$24,000</em></strong> per year, the standard deduction would bring your taxable income down to $0. In turn, your taxes would be $0. Fantastic.</p><p>Next, you can contribute to a traditional IRA. The limits for traditional IRAs is $5500 per person or $11,000 per couple. Remember that a traditional IRA is a pre-tax deduction. Thus; you can earn an additional $11,000 per couple and pay $0 tax. We are now up to <strong><em>$35,000</em></strong>.</p><p>Similarly to IRA, you can also contribute to a traditional 401(k) program with your employer (if the employer is offering it). Each person has an IRS mandated limit of $18,500. Since you’re filing as a couple that gives you a total of $37,000 to deduct. Adding it to the above gives us a total of <strong><em>$72,000</em></strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>There’s one more easy pre-tax deduction left. The health savings account (HSA). This is a great choice for individuals with low medical expenses. Some highly respectable online individuals even describe it as the <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/\">ultimate savings account</a>. For 2018, the limit for a couple is $6,900. Adding that in to our total gives us <strong>$78,900</strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>In many cases, 401(k)’s and HSA’s come with a few more advantages. First, many employers are willing to match at least a part of your contributions. That usually amounts to a few thousand tax free dollars. Additionally, if you are 50 or older, 401(k)’s allow you to sock away another $6000 per individual. That’s another potential $12,000 to put away depending on your age.</p><p>Alright, we got all the obvious things out of the way. If you are not maximizing these, what are you waiting for?</p><p>Now let’s talk about the more esoteric options. First, there’s the 457(b). That’s a special program for government workers. If you are a teacher or a nurse or some other government worker you can usually participate in this plan. 457(b) plan has an interesting feature. Unlike other employer sponsored retirement plans, this option has a separate limit. That means you can contribute to both 401(k) and 457(b). Both also have the same limits. Therefore; if a couple works for the government, that’s an additional $37,000 that can be deducted. That would give you <strong>$115,900</strong> tax free dollars if my math is correct.</p><p>Of course this is not the Soviet Union. We don’t all work for the government. However, there is one other interesting way to reduce your taxes. If you went through my list of terms above, you may remember “capital gains”; the tax applied on investments. The great thing about this tax is that under certain conditions, when your investment “qualifies”, this tax can be 0 percent. You heard that right. You’ll pay nothing. The requirements are also relatively moderate. The main requirement is that your investment must be held for at least a year.</p><p>Once your investment is “qualified”, as long as you manage to keep your total <strong>taxable</strong> income to under $77,200, you’ll actually owe nothing to the government. Taxable is bolded on purpose. Remember that through the power of IRA’s, 401(k)’s and HSA’s we were able to earn $78,900 tax free. That’s because, for the purpose of taxation, you’ve earned $0. Now, if you were to earn an additional $77,200 from capital gains, that would still be taxed at 0 percent due to capital gains taxes. Amazing!</p><p>So what’s the bottom line?</p><p>As a couple with a decent job, you can earn <strong>$78,900</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the state or federal government, you can earn <strong>$115,900 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn an astonishing <strong>$193,100</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple above 50, working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn <strong>$205,100 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>There’s a huge array of further deductions and credits you can look into to reduce your taxes further. If you prefer, you can think of it as increasing your taxable income while keeping your tax obligation at zero. For example, the child tax credit can give you up to $2000.</p><p>However, most of us are not working for the government and do not have a portfolio that can generate $80,000 in capital gains year after year. Yet we can still reduce are taxable income by almost $79,000. To put that in perspective, the median income of a <strong><em>married</em></strong> household in 2016 was roughly $87,000; a little more then you can deduct.</p><p>I’m a strong proponent of saving hard and saving fast. That’s why, I encourage everyone to participate in any government money give away that is available to them within the legal boundaries. Retirement savings programs are “use it or lose” it programs. Make sure you use it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=737acc94778f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/most-money-you-can-earn-without-paying-a-dime-in-tax-737acc94778f\">Most money you can earn without paying a dime in tax</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I promised them a blog post was coming and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/make-it-rain-with-bitcoin-clickbait-218a528a85b1\">delivered it</a>. Since then, I’ve done some more reading about the concept and would like to clarify a few stances.</p><p>Before I do any clarification, I just want to say that I think the idea is actually very interesting. It is modeled after gold and assumes certain positions on the economy and prosperity. The libertarian in me definitely likes where this is going.</p><p>One error that I made when reading about Bitcoin was the assumption that all transactions are completely anonymous. I was under the impression that you can transfer money between two consenting adults and the government cannot politely place their noses in your business and ask for a cut. However, that’s not the case.</p><p>Either way, the idea of modeling it like gold is very intriguing. Every so often, when a conversation turns to money, someone looking to sound smart will state some sort of an opinion about how today’s money is “fiat currency” backed by nothing but thin air and promises. In the good old days, we had the gold standard so each dollar was worth something.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgKkfhi8Eaiw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href\">https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href</a></iframe><p>As the video above points out around the 50 second mark, the gold standard does not mean that money is backed by anything either. Gold is just a convenient way of figuring out who owns what and who owes who. It is like a ledger where we write down all the transactions.</p><blockquote>Gold isn’t valuable because we make jewellery out of it. It’s the other way around.</blockquote><p>As it turns out, good forms of money (such as gold) have 5 properties.</p><ol><li><strong>Scarcity — </strong>Gold is pretty hard to find</li><li><strong>Fungiability —</strong> Any gram of gold is equally valuable</li><li><strong>Divisibility —</strong> You can subdivide gold into smaller pieces to pay for cheaper things.</li><li><strong>Durability — </strong>Gold is a noble metal. Does not react under most extreme weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Transferability — </strong>Exchanging gold coins is reasonably easy and been done for thousands of years.</li></ol><p>Bitcoin meets all of the criteria above and some would argue exceeds these criteria relatively to gold. Does it mean it’s time to remortgage your house and go all in on Bitcoin mining like your Uber driver told you? Not quite. There’s 4 big problems that I see with the current state of crypto-currencies.</p><p><strong>It’s not an investment. </strong>The view that Bitcoin is an investment seems to be the most dangerous to me although it’s a widely held belief. To be fair, it’s hard to argue with results. If you held Bitcoin from 2010 to today you’d be a Zillionaire. Naturally, the typical precautions apply. “Past performance do not guarantee future results”.</p><p>However, I’m mostly referring to the word “investment”. I don’t think it should be used in this case. The reason is that an investment implies some sort of return due to added value. For example, you invest in stocks because you get to own a company that presumably adds value over time. Added value leads to bigger profits. Bigger profits lead to dividends and as a share holder you have a claim on those dividends. Similarly, we invest in real estate because we count on the rental income. We provide the valuable service of shelter and to thank us, the renter hands us dollars.</p><p>Where is the value being added when you store your dollars in the form of Bitcoin? There’s none actually. It’s just a commodity like gold. You may argue that it’s a store of value. You can make an argument that it’s a hedge against inflation (assuming it ever stabilizes in price). But there’s definitely no added value there so it’s not an investment.</p><p>And it isn’t just semantics. Something that is not an investment but you still risk money on to make more money sounds a lot like a gamble. I think that if everyone treated it like a gamble, the results wouldn’t be nearly as exciting. The pundits on TV would have to quiet down and the small talk at dinner will have to shift back to real estate (because that’s what we did before Bitcoin).</p><p><strong>Investors have no clue how it works. </strong>We were having a social gathering the other day. Once we were done talking about Trump for the night, the conversation obviously shifted to Bitcoin. Two of my friends wanted to know what I thought of the idea and if they should invest in it. We started talking about some fundamentals of money and investing when it dawned on me; I was standing next to two world class software engineers neither of whom understood how crypto-currencies worked. Neither did I. However, they were ready to put down thousands of dollars into this “investment”.</p><p>A week later I am chatting with another friend over coffee when he pulls out his phone to show me his portfolio. He has huge gains. Over 80% in just a month. Turns out he invested in 20 different crypto-currencies. However, when I asked him what percentage of the tech he understood, he admitted that it was roughly 0.5%. I appreciate the honesty but worried of the implications.</p><p>To be fair, this is anecdotal but I have a feeling it’s much more wide spread than many realize. Personally, I would never dream of investing in a company without ever knowing at least what they do and looking at some financial ratios. However, in this case, at least in some limited examples, it seems like the default approach is to buy now and figure it out later.</p><p><strong>It’s actually not that useful.</strong> This reason is most up for debate but I think it’s also going to be the most influential. For a currency to be of any use, it must be widely accepted. Bitcoin isn’t quite there yet. Some would argue that it’s just a matter of time until it’s adopted. However, I’m wondering why? Why would anyone actually use it?</p><p>I see one use case for me. I would like to be able to transfer money internationally without paying a middle man. Some people may like to buy guns and blow on the black market. Outside of that, I’m not really sure why it would be adopted. It makes moving money marginally better but adds a lot of barriers that need to be overcome.</p><p>What I’m really saying, is that beyond the hyper paranoid consumer and the mafia Don, there’s very little added value to Bitcoin as a currency. Therefore; I must wonder why it would gain any traction as a currency versus more established ones like the USD. I’m thinking about your average consumer. The ones that make up 95% of the population.</p><p><strong>It can easily be competed out of business. </strong>So there’s Bitcoin. There’s also Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Three weeks ago, I introduced SuckerCoin. In fact, as of this writing, there’s <strong>thousands</strong> of different crypto-currencies you can trade. Crypto-currencies are built on public ideas and open source technologies. There’s very little competitive advantage any one currency has that another cannot just adopt.</p><p>Bitcoin does have the advantage that is the first and best known. However, that could easily be erased over time as others gain (or Bitcoin loses). One option companies use to maintain their competitive advantage is to lobby the government for regulations and licensing to keep competitors out. I have a hard time imagining the Bitcoin lobby passing that through congress though.</p><p>The result is that anyone can start their own crypto-currency. Some of them have even real advantages. For example, Bitcoin has a limitation on how many transactions it can process in a 10 minute block. That is addressed in other currencies. Some currencies don’t even bother with that. They just jump on the hype train. After all, a rising tied lifts all boats.</p><p>If Bitcoin, or any other crypto-currency has any chance of staying around for the long term, it must be the currency that is accepted everywhere. But with thousands of currencies, how would anyone make the right choice? Of course, you could imagine a world where everyone accepts all crypto-currencies. However, in that case, the whole scarcity idea (property #1) becomes … questionable.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think that Bitcoin is a really cool idea. Getting central planning out of our money supply is a goal worth pursuing. Bitcoin should be thought of as version 1.0 of that idea. But just like all good software, we need to keep iterating over it.</p><p>Block-chain (the general idea behind all crypto-currencies) is great. I’m sure it will be widely adopted. Maybe even for our own financial system. Maybe by our governments. Who knows? However, I’m going to stick to the tried and true. I’m keeping my money in a well diversified passively managed index fund and I recommend you do the same. More on that later.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ds2XHyzPA9Zc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href\">https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href</a></iframe><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=375f566905b8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/elaborating-more-on-bitcoin-value-375f566905b8\">Elaborating more on Bitcoin value</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*UzWt816q3LL60RhL2VPK2A.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This is highly inspired by an article from Mr. Money Mustache titled <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/02/insurance-a-tax-on-people-who-are-bad-at-math/\">Insurance: A Tax on the stupid</a> and I found it to be quite influential for my way of thinking about insurance. The premise of the article is simple. Insure only the things you cannot afford to lose. Pay up for the rest because in the long run you’ll save money.</p><p>This makes perfect sense as well. Take any insurance company as an example. It exists for the sole purpose of making money. It does this by paying out less then it brings in. That means, the risk that it’s covering must cost less in the long run then what it charges for it in premiums. I think no one would argue against this idea.</p><p>Humans have two major flaws when it comes to losses. The first is that we seem to feel twice the amount of pain for a loss then an equivalent gain. Putting this in dollars is the easiest way. You’d feel twice as much pain for losing $100 then the pleasure of gaining $100. This is completely irrational but that’s just the way the mind works. It is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\">loss aversion</a>.</p><p>The second flaw is that we are really bad at estimating probabilities. Especially when these events are extremely unlikely. That’s why we have irrational fears about dying in a plane crash but aren’t worried what so ever about heart disease. Yet the former kills a tiny fraction of the latter.</p><p>So given these two flaws of human behaviour, we can now see why insurance becomes a bad deal. An insurance company knows roughly how likely houses are to burn down or your electronics getting damaged. With a large enough pool of people, they can calculate the risk reasonably well and then distribute it over many premium payers. In fact, since we over estimate the likelihood and the pain of loss, they can charge us significantly more for it.</p><p>The other issue I have with insurance is that people seem to insure absolutely everything of any moderate value. For example, people buy extended warranty on their TV’s and phones. They buy extended coverage on their cars. They insurance their pets. Etc. So what’s the problem?</p><blockquote>The problem is that it’s generally a big waste of money.</blockquote><p>Not only are you making money for the insurance companies but also it’s extremely silly to insure something you could afford to repurchase without thinking twice about it. If someone dents my car and I felt the need to fix it, I could pretty easily afford to do it and never think about it again. I wouldn’t bother going to the insurance company for it.</p><p>So the general rule of thumb is very simple. Buy insurance only if you cannot afford the replacement or the bills to fix it. For example, if my house burned down and I needed to rebuild it, I could not afford it. Thus; I insure my house. On the other hand, my deductible for my insurance is set to the maximum because I can afford to pay for it out of pocket.</p><p>And if you stop to think about the purpose of insurance, you’ll realize that is there to cover you in case of a catastrophic events. It is not there to save you $20. Dropping your flat screen TV on the floor is not a catastrophic event so buying extended insurance is plain dumb. Unless of course it is in which case buying a flat screen TV is plain dumb.</p><p>There’s one other situation that you can justify buying insurance for. It is very specific and you’re unlikely to run into but I feel I should mention it anyway. It is the time when you have some additional information that the insurance company doesn’t that significantly increases your risk. For example, let’s say you’re extremely shitty driver but you’re getting a great quote from GEICO. If you have a really good reason to believe that the insurance company is underestimating their risk significantly, go ahead and insure. But That’s unlikely to be true and the gain is probably not very significant.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=92da25663721\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">What to insure</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s a great read and I highly recommend that you open it in a new tab and read it later :-) Fun fact, it is also the post that got me hooked on his blog.</p><p>Yesterday I think I managed to identify another set of clowns. I call them escalator clowns. I’m not going to claim that this term is invented by me. I imagine some people on the interwebs have used it before. However, I think we all know who I’m talking about.</p><p>I’m not claiming that anyone who ever takes the escalator is an escalator clown. There’s plenty of good reasons to take the escalator. You can have bad knees for example. You may have a child with you who loves to ride the escalator. There might not even be an alternative such as stairs.</p><p>However, if you eliminate all of the options from above and you still decide to take the escalator, you’re not yet an escalator clown. To turn into an escalator clown, you have to take the escalator and then consciously just stand there. That my friend, makes you a clown.</p><p>I just don’t get it. Why would anyone just stand on an escalator? Escalators are slow. People looked bored. There’s nothing pleasant about it. The only reason I can fathom is you must be conserving energy (because you’re starving). Why else would you just stand there and wait? Also, you get two clown points if you’re heading down.</p><p>I ran into this phenomena on my way home from work. I was walking out of an office building and speeding my way towards the exit door when I walked past a lovely lady on the escalator. She turned her head and looked at me with a surprised look as I kept walking (and she was standing). To be honest, I don’t know what was the cause of the surprise. It might have been my mere presence.</p><p>However, I know one thing for near certainty. She was leaving home from her office job. Office jobs tend to be sitting jobs. Her one solid opportunity to stretch those legs just opened up and she decided to squander it anyway. By no means is she the only one. I see this daily. And you probably do too. You can’t tell me all these youngish people have bad knees. So here’s a life lesson for you:</p><blockquote>Don’t be an escalator clown. Don’t stand to the right. Just walk.</blockquote><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3b3392d450df\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/escalator-clowns-3b3392d450df\">Escalator clowns</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I was looking forward to earning money. My pay was going to be in the thousands. I was excited to wear dress shirts and pants and walk around downtown looking important. It was a big change from my university days. Then the recession happened.</p><p>I wasn’t knowledgeable enough to understand it at the time. I know some people struggled to find work. My dad lost his job. It would take him another 8 months to find another. I, on the other hand, being a phenomenal performer, was spared (thankfully).</p><p>I do remember the protests on wall street and all the TV coverage they got. They called themselves the 99%. I must have been one of them.</p><p>We were angry about the bailouts. The bankers were saved from bankruptcy despite being responsible for the crash — and our money was used to save them!</p><p>It certainly seemed unfair to me.</p><p>But what could we do? Letting these companies fail would mean the loss of thousands of additional jobs. “It would cripple the economy”.</p><p>We also set a certain expectation. The corporations now understood: once you got large enough, the tax payer will bail you out. We even coined the term “too big to fail”.</p><p>Last week, my friend Ivan and I were discussing this exact topic. What could we do about it? And how could we have avoided this? This time however, being more mature and sophisticated, I’ve had the clarity to voice an alternative opinion. I thought it would be good to share it here with you, dear audience.</p><p>Ask yourself, what does GEICO do to insure your claim? They charge a premium of course. You pay a monthly fee for the <strong>insurance</strong> that someone will cover you in case of a loss. Naturally, you cover for large losses that would hurt you financially.</p><p>You might see where I’m going with this.</p><p>We can determine which companies are “too big to fail”; we can use an income or employee count threshold or another metric (or a combination). Once a company crosses that income level (or employee count), each additional dollar earned would be subject to double the tax rate.</p><p>Before all my libertarian friends lose their shit, let me explain.</p><p>You can view the additional tax as a premium paid into a bailout fund. In case of gross mismanagement and undue risk, the responsibility of bailing out these large corporation doesn’t fall on the tax payer but on the companies themselves.</p><p>In reality, no prudent corporation would be willing to pay more tax than necessary. Instead, as the corporation approaches this limit, they will likely split into sub-units.</p><p>Amazon would become Amazon AWS and Amazon Retail; Microsoft would become Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows, Walmart would become Walmart East and Walmart West. You get the idea.</p><p>I’d be lying if I told you I came up with this idea myself. This is taken from <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f138bf5466fe\">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> and his excellent book “<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QtaqLM\">The Black Swan</a>” (no relation to the movie).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan\">The Black Swan</a></p><p>For every great idea, there’s going to be <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">some detractors</a>.</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered=\"true\"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-align=\"center\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p>For Google or Amazon the &#39;break them up!&#39; argument is even less coherent, since these companies do not have clearly separate divisions with stand-alone viability. Breaking up Amazon is like breaking up Walmart - into what? Fruit in one company and vegetables in another?</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1071179241440460800\">@benedictevans</a></p></blockquote><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === \"#amp=1\" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: \"amp\", type: \"embed-size\", height: height}, \"*\");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute(\"width\")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute(\"width\", \"500\");}}</script><p>I find this tweet ridiculous. You really can’t think of a way to break up Amazon? Amazon does <strong>everything</strong>.</p><p>And Google? It happens to be a great example of this principal — although in a much milder form. It has a holding company, Alphabet, and it spins out experimental companies, Waymo, Sidewalk Labs, etc.</p><p>Also, no company is forced to spin out every single line of business they have. If a business isn’t mature yet to stand on its own — if it’s a money loser for example — keep it. Every decision is completely up to the board and shareholders.</p><p>Finally, some people are worried that large companies will lose their competitive advantage; efficiencies of scale or something along those lines. Maybe. But that’s debatable. It could equally play out in the opposite direction.</p><p>Imagine for instance if Amazon decided to spin out its warehousing operations. Wouldn’t other companies benefit from all the efficiencies gained by Amazon?</p><p>You might be asking if a company would even bother investing in innovation if they’ll spin it off. My answer to you is of course! The investment in innovation doesn’t just disappear. It is sold. A shareholder with one share of Amazon, after the split, would end up with one share of Amazon — priced X dollars lower— and one share of the new company — priced at X. That’s just how spin offs work.</p><p>The end result of such policy is no corporate bailouts, no Dodd, no Frank, no endless bickering, no bureaucrats and no government agencies.

If you’re curious, you can read on Wikipedia about … let’s call it, “controversial”, things he claimed. What is noteworthy is that in the last few weeks, he’s been banned from every major social network on the planet.</p><p>The banning naturally sparked a long debate about freedom of speech versus advancing nonsense.</p><p>On the one hand, we wonder how a platform like Twitter allowed this guy to spread this trash about vaccines and the Sandy Hook shooting. It’s hard enough to tell what’s true and what’s an alternative fact. The last thing we need is more BS floating around inspiring the feeble minded.</p><p>On the other hand, if you live in a free country, you are generally entitled to the freedom of speech. In the case of the United States, it turns out to be the very first amendment.</p><p>The issue of free speech versus talking trash has been debated for decades yet there is no consensus. It usually goes along the same lines. One party claims some speech is offensive. They suffered psychological harm and will report it to the authorities once they get out of their safe spaces. The other party tells them to stick their noses somewhere else since it’s a protected right to say what you want.</p><p>I remember one such incident from a few months back with Nina, Bob, and Michael. We were arguing if Twitter should scrap anonymity on it’s platform and make it mandatory to be verified. Bob and Nina supported mandatory verification. The idea was that people who hide behind anonymity are far more likely to troll on Twitter. This leads to a very toxic environment.</p><p>Michael and I argued that this hampers free speech. Yes, you still technically can say anything you want on Twitter. But when your name is tied to it, you won’t.</p><p>But that got me thinking:</p><blockquote>What’s so good about free speech anyway? Why is that an end goal in itself?</blockquote><p>Turns out, the internet has answered that question already in a beautifully crafted YouTube clip. However, instead of linking to it, I think I’ll summarize the interesting parts here.</p><p>In the clip, the presenter notes four reasons for defending the freedom of speech:</p><p><strong>Freedom of speech is fundamentally necessary if you plan to oppose it.</strong> I found this idea to be uniquely intriguing and convincing. Allow me to explain.</p><p>Imagine you’d like to advocate for the restriction of free speech. You go on stage in the middle of a busy intersection, and right before you’re about to yell into the mic, a couple of thugs grab you by the throat and drag you down.</p><p>What happened? A society where speech is restricted can choose to restrict your speech as well — Including your advocacy to the restriction of speech. Thus; you end up in a weird conundrum. To <strong>ensure</strong> the ability to advocate for the restriction of speech, you must have freedom of speech. Oh the irony.</p><p><strong>Freedom of speech is important to share ideas.</strong> This is the most common argument I hear for defending the freedom of speech. There are plenty of examples in history when people were wrong. The only way we were able to correct ourselves is by allowing people who figured it out to share their solutions.</p><p><strong>Freedom of speech is important to a free and democratic society.</strong> The presenter explains how a totalitarian system of leadership in a country cannot exist with freedom of speech. The reason is that if someone decides to rise up against the leader, the leader will certainly deal with them through their preferred means — be it prison or execution. However, no leader can deal with the entire population rising up. This can happen only with a sufficient amount of free speech. This is also why most authoritarian countries go above and beyond to suppress the flow of ideas.</p><p><strong>Freedom of speech allows to resolve conflicts and come to consensus through discussions instead of prejudice and ignorance. </strong>We cherish open communication in universities, workplaces, between friends and family, between countries, between people of different background, between people of differing political ideologies and so on for a reason. Through open communication, we are able to resolve conflicts that would otherwise escalate to violence, divorces, wars and spoiled children.</p><p>Does this mean I take an absolutist stance on this? Can you just say anything you want and get away with it? Sort of.</p><p>I believe that we should let society punish you. If you spew vile garbage and ideas, I will not associate with you. Neither will the rest of the world. This is a great, built in mechanism to guide society in the direction of acceptable speech.</p><p>We do this with people all the time. If you act selfish or rude, if you are inconsiderate or an overall shitty human being, we turn away from you. We don’t need any laws or regulations from the government. Everyone is free to choose their associations.</p><p>Of course, no article would be complete without mentioning the often cited limitation on free speech:</p><blockquote>falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.</blockquote><p>At first glance, this seems like a reasonable limitation on free speech and most people are familiar with it; except it isn’t true — at least not anymore. The decision, related to this case was overturned in 1969. And even if it wasn’t, I’d encourage everyone to read about the reasoning of the case itself. It was about the right to distribute pamphlets opposing WWI. I don’t think that punishing the act of opposing a war belongs in a free society.</p><p>Similarly, there is always the question of speech that calls to immediate violence. It seems to be the one exception to free speech where simply turning away from that individual is not enough. There’s a level of urgency to it where societal condemnation just doesn’t work sufficiently. Interestingly; the U.S. justice system (and most of the other developed countries) agree with me.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d5f882b15b89\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/so-why-is-freedom-of-speech-important-anyway-d5f882b15b89\">So why is freedom of speech important anyway?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

The only thing I can relate to is Serena Williams’ reaction to the penalties.</p><p>I think when Serena got her third violation for “verbal abuse”, she must be evaluating if it was a fair call. The umpire’s judgement could be the result of automatic, emotional, stereotypical reaction, derived from his <em>Thinking Fast</em> system. Alternatively, it could be a result of the logical, calculating, conscious decision, derived on his <em>Thinking Slow</em> system. (Read more about the two thinking systems in the Book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555\">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>)</p><p>She claimed double standard because <em>“there’s men out here who do a lot worse…”</em> and didn’t receive the same penalty. It must be the bias brain that issued the unfair penalty.</p><p>At work, I face some criticisms that made me come close to call a double standard.</p><p>One time I received a feedback that I was <em>“aggressive”</em> because I put some pressure on my teammates to deliver by his own deadline. Another time, I was viewed as <em>“interruptive”</em> when I started asking a question before the interview candidate completed his response.<strong> I do not believe that I acted or said anything different from my male teammates in the same situation. In fact, I learn from the best male examples who were thought of having “strong ownership” and “great interviewing style”.</strong></p><p>When receiving this type of criticism, there are two options. 1) I can refuse to believe them, and call out sexism. 2) I admit the feedback, and change my behavior.</p><blockquote>I am telling you, every girl I know takes the second option because we all know this kind of fight will not result in a win. I have never heard any male colleague admits that he treats a woman with double standard or being sexist. The argument always ends before it starts.</blockquote><p>This is precisely why I sympathize with Serena William. Not because everything she did was appropriate (abusing racket and letting emotion into the argument are far from ideal behavior). But because she chose the first option, the hard way.<strong> She stood up even when there was a tiny chance to win; to voice that unfairness could be real and woman should be viewed as equally capable as men.</strong></p><p>While many researches show that cultural norms and expectations about men and women influence how people of different genders are judged, evaluated, and treated at work, it wasn’t enough to convince myself that I was part of the problem. It’s mostly because I struggled to find a true A/B testing experiment to prove that my co-worker will actually treat me differently if I am male.</p><p>Yet, that’s not the toughest part.</p><blockquote>The most challenging part, in tech, is that most of my role models are men.</blockquote><p>They embrace strong opinion (loosely held) and believe that system is fair. But, no one tells me what to do when strong opinion can be sometimes <em>“too strong” </em>for my gender, and that the system could be built on top of the unconscious bias. They don’t have to face the same problems or criticisms.</p><p><strong>The point of this article is not to call out any sexism at my workplace, but to emphasize that the tendency of humans to <em>think fast </em>should not be overlooked. </strong>Awareness is the start. I strongly believe in tech industry because we value the right logic and we are highly capable of changing the world for the better place.</p><p>Thank you, Serena Williams who inspires this blog post. It is always easier to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f72667938d70\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-i-relate-to-serena-william-on-sexism-f72667938d70\">How I relate to Serena Williams on sexism</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

As of the latest Google search, his net worth exceeds $140 billion dollars. That’s billion with a ‘B’.</p><p>I was chatting with my neighbour Esther the other day about her upcoming move to Portland. Turns out the hot housing market in Seattle created irresistible conditions for a post-retirement, single woman to move to a cheaper cost of living area. As a side benefit, she will also be much closer to her kids. While I’m sad to see her go, I can’t help but feel excited about what that means for the value of my own house across the street. That feeling really makes up for her loss.</p><p>If you live in Seattle, and you’re not talking about the housing market, the next natural topic to bring up is the homeless situation which we turned to next. We both noticed a significant uptick in homelessness around the neighbourhood. We both agreed that it is being mishandled and something must be done. She even suggested Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, should do something about it. After all, “He’s got $100 billion dollars. Who needs that kind of money?”.</p><p>Wait a second …</p><blockquote>“Who needs that kind of money?”</blockquote><p>Now I have a problem with that. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t disagree that $100 (now $140) billion dollars is an absurd amount of money to have. I don’t disagree that he is probably financially independent; that he could retire early; that he doesn’t need to worry about skyrocketing health care costs and a single day fluctuation in his net worth is more money than I’ll see in a life time.</p><p>What I do disagree with is the following: Since when are we in the business of deciding who’s had enough?</p><p>There is a multitude of reasons why the statement above is wrong — both politically, economically and morally. Many of which are out of scope for this article. I do want to focus on one in particular though.</p><p>Jeff Bezos started a company. He created a great product. Millions of people are using it everyday. He revolutionized many industries. He created <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf98680c-738f-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c\">thousands of jobs</a>. The money is his reward. Is the reward large? yes. But so is his impact. We are talking about an $800 billion dollar company.</p><p>Was there any coercion? Did anyone force us to hand over our hard earned money to him? Did he do anything illegal? Did you truly love Barnes &amp; Noble?</p><p>No. In fact, we did it all out of our own free will.</p><p>Would it be great if Jeff decided to shower the city of Seattle with hundred dollar bills until the entire homeless population and all our city representatives are living in luxury?</p><p>Yes, that would be great. If so he chooses.</p><p>One of the great things about living in a free society is the freedom to choose. Jeff can decide to spend his money any way he wants to. You may have even seen the following tweet:</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered=\"true\"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-align=\"center\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p>Request for ideas...</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/875418348598603776\">@JeffBezos</a></p></blockquote><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === \"#amp=1\" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: \"amp\", type: \"embed-size\", height: height}, \"*\");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute(\"width\")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute(\"width\", \"500\");}}</script><p>A path towards a free society must be a path that let’s the individual direct their own destiny.

This is not glorious work but needs to be done. In the past, this would have been a pretty miserable experience for me. Going through the house room by room, looking through all my shit and putting it back in it’s place just didn’t seem to be all that interesting. I could probably come up with two dozen better things to do.</p><p>These days I feel a little different about it. I actually enjoy cleaning. I love going around the house and putting things back in their place. I love finding things that I don’t need and tossing them out. Have I lost my marbles?

Specifically, I discovered “<a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/\">The minimalists</a>” and <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/7c19949c6acd\">Marie Kondo</a>. I can’t tell you enough about how great it is to sit in a house where all the dishes are clean, the books are on the book shelf and your clothes are in the closet. The room is spacious and calm and you don’t feel the anxiety that comes with disorganized room.

You won’t see a difference until the first leaf breaks through the soil. Planting requires the right temperature, appropriate timing, sufficient lighting, and much more to be successful. Same goes with meditation; posture, frequency, and duration matter.</p><h3><strong>How long does it take?</strong></h3><p>It depends on how thick the soil is. In this analogy, it’s how self-aware you are.</p><blockquote>For me, it takes 10 minutes a day, 7 days a week, for 4 weeks to see the benefit.</blockquote><p>To experience the benefit of meditation, you need to be mindful enough. But, to be more mindful, you need to practice more meditation. Hence, at the beginning, you may not even be aware of the small changes. The progress is still under the soil.</p><p>One does not simply count their breaths to unlock the power of meditation.</p><h3><strong>Get the logistic right</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>I recommend to use guided meditation.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> is great for the beginner because it repeatedly walks through the core practices <em>(see below)</em>.</li><li><strong>Sit up right.</strong> <em>Laying down meditation never works (I tried).</em></li><li><strong>Meditate for at least 10 minutes.</strong> The mind needs enough time to calm down and adjust to the practice.</li><li><strong>Do it everyday.</strong> This is the most important rule. At the beginning, skipping one day felt almost like starting over again. Leverage the <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">power of habits</a> to see progress faster.</li></ul><h3><strong>Understand the core concept</strong></h3><p>We practice mindfulness in one of two ways: focused attention and open monitoring. They are quite different but both are essential.</p><ul><li><strong>Focused attention exercise </strong>can be done by focusing on one object like breathing. Buddhist monk practices mindful walking; paying attention to the feet that touch the ground, and the weight that pulls down due to gravity.</li></ul><blockquote><em>Focused attention exercise is helpful to sharpen the focus and overcome the distraction in day-to-day life.</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Open monitoring</strong> can be done by being aware of any sensation, thought or emotion that emerge without being attached to it. Instead of focusing on a particular object, keep the mind open to any sensations. See it appear and let it goes without processing it.</li></ul><blockquote>Open monitoring is helpful to let go of any present emotion, attachment to the past, and expectation of the future, which consumes our energy unnecessarily.</blockquote><h3><strong>Benefit</strong></h3><p>I found that practicing mindfulness strengthens the ability to follow my own thought process to a great extent. <strong>I can reach to a deeper reasoning and watch closely how ego and emotion influence any action or decision. </strong>Mindfulness also gives the clarity to my subconscious thought such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity, which are the root of my reasoning flaw. Taking time to practice mindfulness is not only important but necessary in this chaotic society.</p><p>Like physical exercise, meditation is the exercise of the mind. It will takes the regular practice for months to get the six-pack mind.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e62e00b57368\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-meditation-doesnt-work-e62e00b57368\">Why meditation doesn’t work</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It is clear that earning fulfillment along the way is as important as reaching to the end goal. A friend asked me a very important question: <em>how do we enjoy every moment while still having a sense of a future goal? </em>I think of it this way:</p><blockquote><strong>Completion of a big goal = SUM(small daily action)</strong></blockquote><p>For example, my goal to write a book is far-fetch and has always been postponed. Writing one page every week (for 3 years) actually seems more achievable! The only way to get myself to write repeatedly is to <em>build the habit around it.</em></p><h3><strong>Deliberately building habits</strong></h3><p>My favorite book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526875534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit\">Power of Habit</a> suggests that any habit consists of 3 parts.</p><blockquote>First, there is a <strong>cue</strong>, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the <strong>routine</strong>, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a <strong>reward</strong>, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop… becomes more and more automatic<em>.</em></blockquote><p>Defining the cue is crucial. What worked best for me is to select a specific time, location, and vibe all together as a cue. I pick my favorite instrumental music, and sit on the couch on Sunday morning to get my brain engaged. I do my writing routine. Then I publish it to get the readers’ feedback as a reward. It gets easier over time as the habit is formed.</p><p>Majority of the time, I forget about the overarching goal and mostly enjoy doing my routine.<strong> The right set of habits can maximize your sense of fulfillment while still keeping you on track for the long term achievement.</strong></p><h3>Replacing bad habits</h3><p>Now that we know what is the good habits to keep or create, it’s time to get rid of the not-so-good habits. The best way is to replace the routine.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Keeping the same cue and reward; substituting the routine.</em></strong></blockquote><p>Say I want to stop checking social media first thing in the morning. First, I must identify the cue and the reward. I know the cue is the sound of the alarm clock, and the reward is the feeling of being awake afterwards. I choose to replace social media with reading (since it contributes to my long term goal). I delete the social media apps and replace them with reading apps. It feel a bit different at first, but overtime, the brain gets the same reward and it adjusts to the change. This strategy works all the time as long as you understand your cue and reward.</p><p>Identifying a good habit and deliberately replacing the bad ones is a continuous process. Overtime, I come to a set of habits that I do daily.</p><h3><strong>Realize enemy of habits</strong></h3><p>Life can’t be all planned. Many times, the unplanned events must override the schedule and break your flow. It can even break the yearly habit in a day. Spontaneous habit changes must happen to match the circumstances. This is perhaps the most difficult part about operating life on a set of habits.</p><blockquote><strong>The best way to cope with change is to be self-aware, constantly reflecting upon the self and understanding our own desire.</strong></blockquote><p>Being self-aware also helps with reinforcing the habit consciously when the cues or rewards are missing. It’s a fallback mechanism to maintain a long lasting habit.</p><h3>Super Habit</h3><p>Like any other goal, self-awareness can be practiced and strengthened. I found the <strong>habit of meditation </strong>to contribute highly to self-awareness. The mind is just like the body. It needs to be well-maintained and exercised.</p><p>Meditation gives the mind a chance to reorganize all the information. It is also a practice to de-focus on the past and future, and re-focus on what happens in the present. With higher consciousness, the mind is sharpened to understand and deal with uncertainty in life better.</p><p>I would denote meditation as my super habit because it keeps all other habits together. (I will write more about this later!)</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I believe that the better the plan, the easier the execution. <em>The journey to complete your big goal must be thought through</em>. Building good set of habits and maintain them is the fastest way to get there.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6cf095b2eacd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">How I build the right set of habits</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Everyone is always trying to change something about themselves. The typical things includes the food they eat, the amount of exercise they get, how they spend their time and how they prioritize their lives. Turns out, change is harder than reading a blog online.</p><p>People are also creatures of habit. We all have our morning routines, our night routines, our commute to work routine and the web sites we visit on our lunch break routine. In fact, when we are put in new environments where executing our routines is hard, we generally tend to skip workouts and eat fried chicken for dinner.</p><p>I am going to share with you an approach that I use to form better habits. It is not fool proof. It does require some upfront investment. However, I believe it could work for almost any habit you are trying to form as long as you apply enough creativity. The system is very simple to apply. All you have to do is <em>create a system. </em>Yes, you read that right, the system is to create systems. Let me explain.</p><p>When I say “system”, I’m talking about a set of rules, or guidelines you use to guide your choices. The side effect of those rules should be that you execute your desired habit. Think of these rules as formalizing a contract with yourself. The contract has at least one rule: <em>I can have as much [A] as I want. However, before I get [A], I must do [B]</em>. This is what I call a personal contract.</p><p>The inspiration came from <a href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\">Dr. BJ Fogg</a>, a researcher in behaviour design who had a great TED talk a few years back about this exact topic.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%3Fstart%3D689%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D689&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAdKUJxjn-R8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href\">https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href</a></iframe><blockquote>If you use an existing behaviour in your life, and you put the new, tiny behaviour <em>after </em>it, you can use the existing behaviour to be the trigger.</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, over time, I noticed that simply defining the contract wasn’t always enough. Frequently, I couldn’t uphold the contract for long or I would completely forget about it. In fact, it was really a hit or miss — occasionally it would work really well but periodically it would completely fall apart.</p><p>More recently, I took a look at some personal contracts I was able to maintain for a long stretch and tried to boil it down to what made them different. I have identified four hallmarks of a good personal contract.</p><p><strong>Automatic.</strong> If you can set this up for your desired habit, your job is practically done. For example, before I spend any money, I max out my 401k. I can automate this through my paycheque contributions. Done!</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to automate certain areas of your life. Exercising effectively requires you to be doing exercise. Calling your mom once a week requires you to talk (at least for now).</p><p>However, there’s a clear subset of bad habits that can be automated away. Anything digital will naturally fall here. Do you have bad browsing behaviour? Are you spending too much time on your Twitter/Facebook/YouTube ? There’s an app for that. Are you having trouble saving or budgeting? There’s a bank for that.</p><p>The advantage of automating bad habits away is you only have that upfront cost once but you reap the dividends indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Breaks down barriers. </strong>One habit that I recently found to be absolutely effortless is the habit of eating a healthy lunch. In the past, I’ve tried cooking at home or buying out healthy lunches but inevitably you skip cooking for a few nights and end up ordering a large barbacoa burrito at Chipotle. You do it enough times and getting back to cooking regularly becomes more and more unlikely.</p><p>How many barriers can you identify with my past system? First, cooking at home is a pain in the ass. Second, when buying food outside, there are far too many temptations. Third, even if I manage to convince myself to buy a salad, in the back of my mind I’m always thinking it’s a bad a deal because I’ll stay hungry after that salad.</p><p>Here is my new approach: my current employer provides catered lunches every day. I made a personal contract with myself to eat a giant bowl of salad from the salad bar first. <strong>Once</strong> I’m finished with the bowl, I can have absolutely <strong>anything</strong> I want. There are no limits. This contract addresses all barriers I’ve had for eating a healthy lunch. I don’t have to cook anything; I am not tempted by anything else since choices are limited; and I am not getting a bad deal because I can have anything I want afterwards. I just need to get through that bowl of salad first. As an added bonus, there’s very little I can eat once I’m done with the salad. I tend to be much more ambitious when hungry.</p><p>In general, try and identify all the little excuses you are giving yourself to stop doing what you really want to be doing. Once identified, try to design your life in a way that will break down those excuses in the most effortless way possible.</p><p>Other barriers usually include, distance, accessibility and ease of use. Watch out for these.</p><p><strong>Sets the correct incentive.</strong> You know how we said before you get [A] you must do [B]? Make sure that whatever [A] is, it is motivating enough to act as a trigger. If you remember reading my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">commitments for 2018,</a> you’ll recall that one of my commitments was to drink two cups of coffee a day. Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that as time goes on, I am creeping back to three cups. Each time I have it, I feel a little guilty but I reason that starting tomorrow I’ll be better. Instead of feeling guilt, I can turn this around and use it to my advantage.</p><p>I am a member of a gym located in the same building where I work. I am making the following personal contract: each time I feel like having a third cup of coffee, I must <strong>first</strong> hit the gym. The barriers to work out are exceedingly low and now I also have a great incentive to do the right thing (the fact that I made it public is a bonus).</p><p>You can generalize this approach as well. Essentially, you sacrifice one minor bad habit to enforce and carry out a major good habit by setting up the right incentives for yourself.</p><p><strong>Consistent with the individual.</strong> Sometimes, despite all the automation, best intentions, lowest barriers, and most enticing incentives, you still fail at your habit building; and that’s okay.</p><p>Coming up with these systems is an iterative process. You will always be tinkering with them. Always trying something new. Always looking for a better way of doing things. You’ll never get it just right the very first time.</p><p>The key is to keep trying new ways of doing things and experimenting with what works for you. For example, a cup of coffee might be enough to motivate me to go to the gym. You might want a new pair of sneakers instead. If that’s your barrier, don’t bother with my system. It won’t work for you.</p><p>When I come up with great systems that work for me, I am always very proud and happy to share — just wait until I write my post about budgeting.</p><p>Let me know if you have a system you are particularly proud of. I am always looking to tweak mine and share with others.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac415f0a8c79\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-state-of-the-art-system-to-goal-setting-ac415f0a8c79\">My state of the art system to goal setting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

This is not glorious work but needs to be done. In the past, this would have been a pretty miserable experience for me. Going through the house room by room, looking through all my shit and putting it back in it’s place just didn’t seem to be all that interesting. I could probably come up with two dozen better things to do.</p><p>These days I feel a little different about it. I actually enjoy cleaning. I love going around the house and putting things back in their place. I love finding things that I don’t need and tossing them out. Have I lost my marbles? What’s with the change of heart?</p><p>What happened is, I discovered minimalism. Specifically, I discovered “<a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/\">The minimalists</a>” and <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/7c19949c6acd\">Marie Kondo</a>. I can’t tell you enough about how great it is to sit in a house where all the dishes are clean, the books are on the book shelf and your clothes are in the closet. The room is spacious and calm and you don’t feel the anxiety that comes with disorganized room. Simply can’t recommend enough!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9186aa419ebd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-9186aa419ebd\">Minimalism</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

For me, it all started a three weeks back. Up until that point, I thought very little about my toilet (as I should). My most memorable recollection was installing a soft close cover on it so it wouldn’t bang when I put the seat down. Otherwise, it was just like every other toilet — white, round and a great place to browse your phone.</p><p>So what lessons could I possibly learn from this familiar household item? Allow me to offer the following <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=allegory\">allegory</a>.</p><p>As many of you know, I dabble in a some <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">house hacking</a>. I rent out my basement on Airbnb to random people on the internet. On Sunday I got the following lovely message from my guests: “the toilet isn’t flushing”. Thankfully, there was nothing in there I couldn’t handle. I headed downstairs, pulled out the plunger and started plunging vigorously. I plunged for about an hour. I tried all sorts of techniques. I put hot water in there. I put soap in there. I ended up with a bowl full of hot soapy bubbles. Eventually, I had to admit that I needed professional help.</p><p>I called the first plumber I could find on Google. He showed up within a few hours looking ready to unclog some pipes. He started with the auger (long wire you stuff in the toilet). He stuck it in there, rotated it a bunch of times but no luck. He removed the toilet off the floor and tried again. Still no luck. All I could think was “What the hell did those hippies flush down my toilet?”.</p><p>He mentioned we’re going to need some more heavy duty equipment. Keep in mind that I have Airbnb guests in my house with a dysfunctional toilet. They are not going to be very happy. On top of it, I live in an old house. Our pipes are… questionable. How much is this going to cost me? I am now quite nervous.</p><p>We brought down a 400 pound roll of metallic tubing. He stuck it in the pipe and started unwinding it in. He kept going all the way to the end. When he pulled it out, we found an extension cord wrapped around the metallic tubing.</p><p>As we both stood there scratching our heads wondering how this is even possible, my wife was still thinking straight. She Googled it quickly and identified it as a part of our sewage pump. Turns out if your toilet is below the sewage line, you need a pump to get the waste out (makes sense once you think about it). The plumber must have ripped off the cord while digging for clogs.</p><p>He put the toilet back in place; Charged me $350; told me I need to get a qualified professional and bounced.</p><p>I started to frantically call anyone who could possibly help. I needed this done ASAP. We have paying customers in the house who need to … use the facilities. The best I could do is get a guy to show up in two days. The estimate for a replacement was $1600.</p><p>I don’t know if you’ve ever dealt with plumbers, electricians or any general maintenance workers but they aren’t exactly known for being reliable.</p><p>That night, I couldn’t sleep. I was worried the plumber wouldn’t show; replacing the pump wouldn’t fix the issue; or that it would escalate to more problems. I woke up the next day with a big headache — exhausted and stressed.</p><p>On a whim, I decided to call the initial company and complain about the plumber; maybe they’ll offer me a discount. I dialed their number, and politely explained what happened. Instead of a discount, they offered to fix the pump for free. Another plumber showed up later in the day, replaced the pump within an hour and charged me nothing for labour and material.</p><p>Once he finished, I rushed downstairs and started flushing that toilet over and over. Flushing never felt so good. The next night, I slept like a baby. I don’t remember the last time I slept that well. I woke up refreshed, feeling great, ready to take on the world.</p><p>What really inspired this story is how vividly I remember the difference in those two days. When the toilet was broken and everything seemed like an endless series of disasters, life was hard — I was stressed and miserable. Dealing with this shit (pun intended) was not fun. Once the toilet service was restored, my life was turned upside down. I felt free. I felt good. I felt like anything was possible. In short life was glorious again. What a difference 24 hours can do for your well being.</p><p>More importantly, I recognized how much we take for granted. As long as this toilet was working, I never paid attention to it. I pulled the lever down. The water flushed away all my troubles. Life went on. However, once this process failed, my outlook changed. All of a sudden my house wasn’t this impenetrable castle but a money pit. And running that Airbnb wasn’t a license to print money but just a bunch of hassles.</p><p>Granted, I did not feel like that for long. Once everything was fixed and settled, I was more than happy to take my guests’ money for the right to stay in my basement (I did offer a free night for the trouble). Also, I ended up getting a brand new sewage pump installed for a bargain price.</p><p>Upon reflection, I had to ask myself the following question:</p><blockquote>What can I do to experience life like I did on Monday, everyday?</blockquote><p>In other words, how can I wake up feeling refreshed and energized, all worries alleviated and the anxiety extinguished. Turns out my experience that week is a common phenomena encountered regularly. In fact, we even have an aphorism to explain what happened:</p><blockquote>“You don’t know what you have until it’s gone”</blockquote><p>Duh. Everyone knows that. But what can we do about it?</p><p>One thing I could do is sabotage my plumbing on regular basis and deal with the plumber while my Airbnb guests are watching. I don’t think it’s a scalable solution though so I wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p>Another option is to practice what is usually referred to as “gratitude journaling”. <a href=\"http://thehowofhappiness.com/\">Sonja Lyubomirsky</a> talks extensively about this technique in her book, “The how of happiness”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Happiness-Approach-Getting-Life/dp/0143114956/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535605491&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+how+of+happiness\">The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want</a></p><p>It entails taking two minutes out of your day (or week) to write down 3 things you’re thankful for. It can be anything. It can be as mundane as catching the bus on time or as significant as getting promoted at work or as pivotal as getting engaged. The key to this exercise is to regularly consider all the things you’re thankful for and consciously become a more grateful person.</p><p>I’ve known about this method for years. Yet somehow, this spiritual, new age approach never resonated with me. I would imagine people sitting in a circle, humming, holding their energy crystals with one hand and writing in their journals made of recycled fabrics with the other.</p><p>If the above doesn’t appeal to you, feel free to drop all the spiritual moonshine and concentrate on the psychological benefits. The root act is simple. Think about what you’re thankful for; be grateful, write it down. Repeat tomorrow.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ba883a11224c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-flushing-the-toilet-made-me-appreciate-the-little-things-in-life-ba883a11224c\">How flushing the toilet made me appreciate the little things in life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Hashtags were flying around with snazzy slogans celebrating unity and harmony, identity and integrity and all sorts of other hippy war cries. We got to talk about the company’s future direction and gossip about internal politics.</p><p>Once each day came to a close, we headed to the restaurants to eat the finest Pad Thai San Francisco had to offer. We all had a daily allowance and I’ll be damned if I didn’t use it! On the last day, we had a giant party with unlimited tequila shots and a fish taco stand.</p><p>That night, I downed my fifth fluid ounce of tequila and headed straight for my friend Colin who was in the midst of a deep conversation with Nina and Zack. I don’t know what they were talking about, but I overheard the following phrase</p><blockquote>Your actions reflect your values</blockquote><p>Cool, I thought. Heard that one before. Nothing new. I’ll take that beer now.</p><p>Once the party was over, I stumbled my way to the hotel and passed out.</p><p>The next day I woke up at 10am with a pounding headache. I was incapacitated to my room for the next 9 hours while my liver was hard at work. The only positive outcome of that experience was the opportunity to reflect on my actions.</p><p>I am the guy who preaches the gospel of low sugar diets to anyone who will dare to listen.

I worked hard on my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a> to use my time wisely. I found plenty of time to browse nonsense on the internet throughout that week. I did not however find time to call my mother.</p><p>If the statement above is true — if actions dictate your values — my values are… off. They are certainly not what I expected them to be.</p><p>I am glad Colin brought up that phrase. Thanks to him, I had a mini-epiphany while nursing my hangover.</p><p>Up to last week, my <strong>values</strong> dictated my <strong>actions </strong>— up to a point. Occasionally, I would give myself a break from being good … and be bad. I would drink a little too much. I would browse YouTube a little too long. I would get into an argument on Twitter a little too fast.</p><p>The new me prefaces these “undesirable” behaviours with the following question:</p><blockquote>Does this action reflect my values?</blockquote><p>Does drinking a pint of beer reflect my values? Nope. Maybe I’ll think again before ordering a second round. Better yet, I can go for a tall glass of kombucha instead.</p><p>This approach can work for anyone.

Amidst all the distraction from the likes of Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, one may ask how is it possible to stay productive at all?</p><p>In my mind, there are many things that need to be my attention. However, I usually have a tendency to delay things as long as possible. People call it many things, but I call it <em>laziness. </em>😖</p><p>It could be writing a Medium article, finishing up a chunk of code, reviewing a technical document, or just replying to an email. When I’m left to my own devices, I would basically imagine all these things in my head and feel the insurmountable amount of work that needs done…</p><p>When that grim mood sets in, my hand would instinctively reach into my pocket and pull out my phone.</p><p>This had happened to me multiple times in the past, and it still does from time to time.</p><p>But something <em>changed</em>. Once I discovered the secret cure to counter this terrible disease, I’ve been able to be 10x more productive than before, and as a direct result, bring much more joy into my life. My steps have springs in them, and my every waking day I feel a sense of mission and accomplishment.</p><p>Now, let me share with you my personal secret weapon to increase productivity.</p><h3>MOMENTUM</h3><p>That’s it, I said it. Momentum. It’s a simple word, but a powerful force.</p><blockquote>Momentum is what picks you up when you’re down, keeps you going when you’re overwhelmed, and maintains your focus when you sense distraction.</blockquote><blockquote>Momentum gets rid of triviality, and drives action.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Momentum is the power to produce.</strong></blockquote><p>When I sense that my energy level is low, and yet there are heaps of stuff left to be done, I give myself a mental pat on the back and start with one simple goal: <strong>do one thing at a time</strong>.</p><p>Let me give you an example. I started writing this article on a Tuesday evening at 10.10pm after work. I had just worked out, cleaned up the place and felt really tired.</p><p>Yet, I promised my editor (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a>) that I’ll write at least an article this week to demonstrate mindful living in my own life.</p><p>After I sat down on my bed, my first thought was, <em>“Hmm, there are other, better things I can do with my time. Let’s see what’s on Facebook before I get started…”</em></p><p>One thing led to another, and 10 minutes later I was<em> still</em> on Facebook. How often has this happened to you?</p><p>That’s when I told myself, <em>“OK, let’s try just one paragraph. Let’s see what happens…”</em></p><p>That’s the magic phrase,<strong> <em>let’s see what happens</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>Once you start doing something, the powerful magic of momentum will carry you forward without you knowing it.</p><p>Fast-forward 20 minutes later, and I’ve already written close to 500 words. Much of it will probably be edited out in post-processing, but that’s OK. I have outdone myself, and wrote more than what I set out to do.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important thing is to realize that productivity doesn’t mean getting things done to perfection. Productivity, to me, <strong>means to execute and follow-through</strong>. Getting something out there is much better than nothing at all.</p><p>Once you have momentum behind you, it is much easier to follow that flow and drive things to completion.</p><h3>Tips &amp; Tricks for Building Momentum</h3><p>Here is a list of tips &amp; tricks I use to build momentum in my daily life:</p><ul><li>I <strong>block out a chunk of time</strong> on my calendar every day for my own space. For example, on my work calendar, there’s a chunk of time from 3–5pm that is allocated for coding. I have understanding teammates who don’t book meetings on those power-hours because it’s important for me to keep sanity and have time to myself to do things I need to do.</li><li><strong>Fill in mundane tasks with something productive</strong>. Reading more books is one of my goals for this year. When I feel overwhelmed and need to get away, I’ll try to pull out a book or listen to an audiobook on Spotify. I have a book in my backpack at all times, and having something to put my mind into is very helpful in those situations. The goal here <strong>is to build a productive habit</strong>, and you can replace reading with something else like working out or taking out the trash.</li><li><strong>Set a schedule and stick to it.</strong> Working out is something I dread, yet it’s important for my overall health. Earlier this year when I sat down and analyzed why I wasn’t working out more, I realized that having to drive to the gym and mentally set myself in work-out mode was time-consuming and counter-productive. What I did, then, was I built my own little home gym. My small gym only has some free weights and a bench, but the effects are tremendous. Every day, I’ll spend 30–40 minutes in the gym either lifting or doing a quick jog. Again, I build momentum here by just showing up. <strong>80% of the battle is already won when you show up, and that’s the beauty of momentum</strong>.</li></ul><p>Those are just some examples of how I use momentum in my daily life to drive productivity. I’d like to know if you have any productivity tips to share as well!</p><h3>Credits</h3><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> for proof-reading and providing valuable feedback!</p><p><em>Zhia Chong is a student of mindful living.

Everything is attentively dusted and meticulously arranged. The sink is empty of all dishes. The oven is pre-heating that delicious pot roast. And of course, there’s figs and pistachios neatly laid out in beautiful bowls on the dining table to tie us over until dinner is served.</p><p>In turn, when we invite those friends over, there’s a certain level of underlying obligation to live up to those expectations. If our friends had figs and pistachios, we must have cranberries and walnuts ready for them. If they had a perfectly arranged kitchen cabinet, we must do the same. We certainly cannot afford to wear our comfortable home clothes — we must dress up.</p><p>Of course, this friendly race to outdo each other does not come for free. It actually takes a heavy toll on us. We cannot simply allow to have people over. We must clear up our entire day to do all the cleaning and cooking and shopping and planning. It’s exhausting. Hosting people turned from being a pleasurable bonding activity to a major inconvenience. We end up thinking twice before inviting anyone.</p><p>Here’s what I propose (technically it’s my wife’s idea. Giving credit where it’s due): I propose that we stop putting up these facades to hide behind. We all know that everyone’s houses are a mess when no one is looking. We all know that your fridge isn’t always stocked full of goodies just ready to eat. And you know what? That’s okay.</p><p>This idea makes most millennial aged individuals very nervous for two reasons.</p><ol><li>It will expose things that no one knows about them expect their spouse. However, we don’t have to make it extreme. Take for example the 30 minute warning approach: If you’ll be in the neighborhood, call your potential host 30 minutes ahead of your arrival. That gives them just enough time to pick up their socks off the floor and close the bedroom door.</li><li>As a guest, you also tend to feel awkward about dropping in suddenly. What if they are busy? What if they don’t want to see me? What if ….? I think this reluctance stems from years of being accustomed to all these obligations when you are hosting. In turn, when other people are hosting, you don’t want to impose. These feelings are perfectly reasonable but we must break out of the cycle of doubt.</li></ol><p>Implementing this approach in our day to day lives is easy. All we have to do is tell each other that it’s okay. <strong>It’s okay to just drop by</strong>.</p><p>Naturally, when adopting this, there are three caveats I must mention:</p><ul><li>Make sure your host is home (duh).</li><li>Make sure your host is free. If they are busy, don’t assume it’s an attack on your character. They just have things to do.</li><li>Know your limits. The idea is not to spend your entire Saturday at someone’s house.</li></ul><p>The idea is inspired by observing my own parents and their huge circle of friends. They constantly seem to have people over but they are never particularly stressed out about it. It’s not uncommon to have 3 different sets of people show up throughout the day. They are usually served a cup of tea and whatever they can find available in the fridge.</p><p>This is sort of how I imagine people living in those small European towns in Greece where everyone is old and happy and all they do is socialize. I want to be old and happy too!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=651c5adacc26\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/proposal-dropping-in-on-people-is-not-the-worst-thing-ever-651c5adacc26\">Proposal: dropping in on people is not the worst thing ever</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, my perfectionist wife has been setting up the room for a month prior to that. The possibility of someone giving us a three star rating is just too much to bear. Thankfully, we’ve been getting only five star ratings so far.</p><p>To ensure the five star rating keeps coming, we’ve had to go through each corner of the basement and clear it out, rearrange the furniture and fix any outstanding nagging maintenance issues. As a result, we’ve taken several trunk-loads of stuff straight to Goodwill — mostly random junk that was packed away in the basement, forgotten about and collecting dust.</p><p>The basement was also the place where our TV lived. We do not have another one upstairs. It is also the place where I kept my clothes. My wife graciously allowed me to keep my stuff in the basement while she took over the bedroom closet. It incorporated my own private bathroom as well. We’ve never had to worry where to keep my shaving paraphernalia versus her hair products.</p><p>Since we’ve started renting the basement, things had to change. We’ve shifted from having 1600 square feet to 900. My clothes moved upstairs. We’ve had to isolate a small corner in the closet for me. The bathrooms were unified (it is going through a clean up process as I am writing this). There’s also no more television.</p><blockquote>Essentially, we’ve forced ourselves into adopting a certain level of minimalism.</blockquote><p>Minimalism was never the intention when considering Airbnb. Instead, I was always thinking about our TTF (time to financial independence). That’s because Airbnb is the classic example of passivish income (I made that up). Your existing asset (the house) is doing most of the heavy lifting. You just need to remember to pay the bills. The more you automate, the more passive it becomes.</p><p>One glance around here and you’ll know right away that I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">minimalism</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/tagged/intentional-living\">intentional living</a>. That’s why it came to me as a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise when I realized I am forced to downsize substantially.</p><p>Before you jump to conclusions, this is not some personality disorder or twisted reasoning. I am not actively trying to induce self-harm. This is a very conscious decision. Ponder this idea of <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/\">happiness through subtraction</a> for example to see where I’m coming from. If you’re still not convinced, that’s fine. I’ll have a lot more to say about minimalism in the future.</p><p>In the mean time, for anyone thinking about their TTF, you should know there are some unintended consequences to Airbnb that go well beyond the money; intentional minimalism happens to be one of them.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=53c7a6122982\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">Surprising unintended consequences of Airbnb hosting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Don’t get me wrong, I am not depressed (all my friends can testify!). In fact, I am happy, just not as much as I think I should be. Nothing is seriously wrong or need to be fixed about my life. I have a great paying job, amazing friends and brilliant co-workers, and I feel strong and healthy. Yet I still want to be happier.</p><p>For the past week, I pursued a quest to measure my own happiness. This is surprisingly difficult. The feeling of happiness is not a boolean but a scale. I can roughly estimate an average of 7/10 daily happiness level. I wonder where the missing 3 went.</p><p>Where does 7 came from, you may ask. I imagine my happiness point is derived from some sort of goal or task completion. It could be a small task like doing groceries or a bigger goal like getting a promotion. To explain my thought process better, I made a formula out of it.</p><p>Assume that one atomic unit of happiness is called <em>joy</em>. Each task or goal completion can spark X amount of <em>joy </em>based on level of challenge. My todo list on the weekend looks like this.</p><ul><li>Water a plant <em>= 5 joy after completion</em></li><li>Clean up my bathroom <em>= 30 joy after completion</em></li><li>File taxes <em>= 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium <em>= 100 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>Let’s say my threshold of happiness per day is at 100. If I complete everything in the list (even filing taxes!), I should have a very happy Saturday. Well, the truth is.. not really.</p><blockquote>The pure happiness I feel from achieving goals is only temporary. A better goal is contentment or fulfillment.</blockquote><p>The formula above fails to capture the sense of fulfillment, which comes from having a purpose and being present in the moment. That is why focusing on goal completion alone is for amateurs. We need to feel consistent fulfillment throughout the journey to the goal.</p><p>How should I represent fulfillment in this formula? Since fulfillment is all about enjoying the moment, it should perhaps be represented as <em>joy gain per minute (as long as we feel happy in those minutes)</em>. As time progresses, total fulfillment is equal to the <em>joy/min multiplied by the time spend. </em>Let’s try the formula again.</p><ul><li>Watch Netflix (1 hour)<em> = 1 joy/min + 0 joy after completion</em></li><li>File tax (3 hours) <em>= 0 joy/min + 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium (~5 hour) <em>= 0.2 joy/min + 40 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>You may argue that the fulfillment gain may not always progress linearly with time. For example, if my Medium post took more than 5 hours to write, I would gain no more fulfillment after the 5 hours past. I agree! Well, for the sake of simplicity, let’s ignore that for now and assume only the upper bound of fulfillment that you can reach. Now let’s categorize all tasks into one of the three buckets.</p><ul><li><strong>Highly fulfilling activity. </strong>The activities such as watching Netflix, or drinking with friends are highly fulfilling but provides zero achievement afterwards.</li><li><strong>Pure achievement.</strong> These activities could be painful to go through but yield accomplishment afterward such as cooking, searching for a bike to buy, or filing tax. I wish I could just finish them quickly.</li><li><strong>Highly fulfilling with sense of achievement. </strong>I have only handful of these in my life such as reading a book, learning to snowboard, or writing this blog post.</li></ul><p>This lens is helpful to detach myself from the end-goal ultra focus, and constantly reminding myself to <em>live</em> in the moment. I start thinking of my day as the combination of <em>30% fulfillment and 70% achievement and started optimizing for the third bucket.</em> Many mundane tasks like folding clothes or biking can also be extremely fulfilling and could be part of the bigger goal achievement (if you think about it hard enough).</p><blockquote>Slowly, I feel that completing the goal has become less important, but having the right balance is more crucial to my overall happiness.</blockquote><p>Thank you for reading it this far.

If you haven’t read part I, I encourage you to do so <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">here</a>. Everything will make a lot more sense if you do.</p><p>For those that have fully embraced the smartphone age and lack patience, here’s a quick summary:</p><p>Turns out what we <strong>want</strong> is frequently separate from what we <strong>like</strong>. The things we desire in life do not always bring us happiness. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective. Evolution does not care about your happiness. Its only objective is to propagate your genes. Therefore; your ancestors were rewarded when competing for status and acquiring resources. However, to be happy, you cannot simply chase your desires. Those desires must also bring you long term contentment. You can do this only if you engage both the “want system” and the “like system”.</p><p>Now that you’re up to speed, let’s dig in.</p><p>Shortly after publishing the first article about the two systems, my friend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zhiachong\">Zack</a> asked me a really interesting question.</p><blockquote>What’s an actionable item I can do today to determine what will appeal to my “want” and “like” system?</blockquote><p>I’ll be honest, I had to think long and hard about this one. My gut reaction was to write a piece bashing materialism and status seeking but I feel like it’s not very satisfying. It’s hard to convince anyone that driving a brand new Tesla SUV to work on daily basis will not bring them more happiness in life. Also, as my wife frequently reminds me, “not everyone wants to live like a monk”.</p><p>Consequently, I had to step back and reconsider. What else can you do to engage the “like system”?</p><p>We’ve already established that people are terrible at predicting how much happiness their desires will bring them. We tend to overestimate the pleasure we will gain from positive experiences. Similarly we tend to overestimate the pain we will experience from negative experiences. However, I am aware of at least one method that seems to be somewhat more reliable than our own intuition. <em>All you have to do is find someone who is at the same position you would like to be and ask them how they feel.</em></p><p>This might not be the bombshell you were expecting. However, the consequence of this idea is easy to overlook.</p><p>Consider for instance what you could do if you were buying a new house. You and your spouse might be looking for a 4 bedroom house at a near by suburb in a brand new development. It must have a 2 car garage and a ton of yard space to play ball with your future child. You will use the extra rooms as an office and an extra bedroom whenever your parents visit from out of town. Sure, it will increase your commute and the mortgage payments are a little high, but it’s worth it!</p><p>Sounds familiar? That’s because it is exactly what a typical couple does — at least around this part of town.</p><p>Before signing on the dotted line, and committing to 30 years of debt, you could ask a current home owner, roughly at the same stage of life, roughly with the same house, living in a similar neighborhood, what their day to day looks like. Do they have any regrets? Do they miss renting? How do they feel about Home Depot? What would they change if they could do it over again?</p><p>They may tell you that it’s incredible. It’s everything and more than they hoped for. They love entertaining friends on their brand new deck and all the neighbors are extremely friendly and pleasant. It’s the best decision they could have ever made.</p><p>Another possibility is that the commute is tough and stressful and the mortgage payments are stretching their finances further than they are comfortable. Maintaining it is also a daily grind.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, it is valuable information you didn’t have before. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy\">Dan Gilbert,</a> their response will also be a much better predictor of your future feelings than your own intuition.</p><p>Now let’s take it a step further. What if you didn’t just settle for asking people that are a single step ahead of you. What if you also asked people who are multiple steps ahead of you. For example, if your parents own their home, why not ask them? You could even use the same questions.</p><p>They may tell you it was a great investment and all their retirement savings are in the house. They were able to raise 2.6 children in that house and send them to the best public schools the department of education had to offer.</p><p>Similarly, they could tell you they never once in 20 years walked into that office/bedroom without a feather duster and windex in their hands. They regret not buying a smaller house and using the extra money to travel.</p><p>Again, valuable information but this time from a long term perspective.</p><p>Finally, you can take this advice to it’s logical conclusion. I hesitate to write this because it is a morbid way to think. However, the insight is absolutely invaluable. I am talking about an article appropriately titled <a href=\"https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/\">regrets of the dying</a>. It took me a long time to read this partially because I couldn’t get over how morbid it is. However, I highly encourage everyone to give it a chance. Once I got through it, I realized that the fear of regret is a very powerful reason to live right. It was also indirectly responsible for this article (and many others to come).</p><p>The regrets are of course very emotional and human. I think that all of us can predict at least half of them if we just sat down and tried to list them. Yet there is something powerfully contemplative even as I re-read them.</p><p>One regret I think would resonate with everyone is #4 — I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. This is something that could haunt you your entire life unless you devote a lot of concentrated effort to maintain these relationships. One major reason for this is our endless mobility. It is certainly a great opportunity to meet wonderful people. However, the relationships you form tend to be more shallow. Once “busyness” catches up with you, those are the first to go.</p><p>This is a focus area for myself although I will make it more official in my 2019 resolutions.</p><p>So what would these people tell you about your house choices if you somehow managed to ask them? I cannot speak for them authoritatively, but my guess is they’d tell you <em>to </em><strong><em>live</em></strong><em> your life and stop wasting your time on this shit because it really doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/dGCW_QOPKvc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kristian Gonzalez</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/prediction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1cd65d586463\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-appealing-to-the-like-system-1cd65d586463\">Happiness: appealing to the like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

That’s the section I like to visit. There, you’ll find books like “You are a bad ass” and “The subtle art of not giving a fuck” trending at the top, telling you how to live a better life. An appealing proposition in my opinion. Moreover, as we’ve discussed before, <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-you-should-read-daily-f54d4f8ec845\">reading daily is a must</a>.</p><p>One of the subjects I like most under “self-help” is the subject of happiness. It always intrigued me. If someone figured out how to eliminate heartache and sadness and live in a constant euphoria, I want to know! Turns out, it’s an active topic of research with lot’s of published data.</p><p>Now, I’ve always felt like I had a good natural intuition for happiness. Somehow, the idea of spending on fancy vacations or luxurious experiences never resonated with me quite the same way. I knew that inherently, spending my way to bliss wasn’t going to work; or at the very least, it was going to be very expensive. You can imagine how happy I was when science seemed to agree with me.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100119.Happiness\">Happiness</a></p><p>I just finished reading “Happiness, the science behind your smile”. It is another book reciting more or less what I already knew from other books on the subject. However, It also had a surprising number of insightful observations I never heard before. One of the insights was regarding our “want system” vs our “like system”.</p><p>What is a “want system” you ask? Great question. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Turns out, things that we want in life, like fancy cars, big houses and so forth, do not always make us happier. If we could somehow measure our present life satisfaction, then go out and buy a new car, several months later, our life satisfaction would be more or less the same. The sciency term for that is hedonic adaptation. In fact, the single best predictor of your life satisfaction a decade from now is not your job, education, house or marital status. It is your life satisfaction today.</p><p>In a similar fashion, we have a “like system”. That refers to those things in life that make us happy (things we like). Health, freedom, and respect are all qualities that seem to raise our life satisfaction. Yet, there are plenty of cases when we are working actively against reaching these qualities. For example, everyone knows they should exercise and eat healthy to maintain their health. However, the only time people are motivated enough to eat healthy is a month before a beach vacation.</p><p>It follows that these two systems are</p><ol><li>Distinct</li><li>Could potentially send opposing signals</li></ol><p>A perfect example of this would be volunteering. People that volunteer their time for causes they care about deeply report being happier. Yet there are millions of people everyday who come home and play Xbox (Not sure if Xbox players report being happier).</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect sense. Evolution doesn’t give two hoots about your happiness. Evolution needs you to propagate your genes. Therefore; adapting to your current situation and constantly striving for the next great thing is completely natural. That explains why it’s so hard to be happy with what you have. You’re simply not designed to.</p><p>That’s not to say that the two systems will always mislead you and diverge. There are many cases when the two systems align. For example, socializing. Our “want system” generally agrees with our “like system”. We tend to want to go out and meet our friends and we seem to enjoy our time when we do.</p><p>Another example is marriage. Married people report higher life satisfaction than their single counterparts. That makes sense. Who wants to be alone forever? Of course, it’s also possible that happier people tend to get married more frequently simply because they are more pleasant; an attribution bias 😕.</p><p>So what can you do with this information? I think this can be seen as another framework for making decisions. You evaluate the decision based on what system it appeals to. If it appeals to both, great! Easy win. Continue with what you were doing. If it appeals to one but not the other, maybe it’s a time to step back and re-evaluate. Do you really need to purchase that new iPhone? Should you call your mother or finish reading that article on CNN?</p><p>Or you can always donate all your worldly possessions and go live in a forest 🌲.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8daa263fd80a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">Happiness: our want system vs like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s important to qualify what it means. I think that a lot of people hear about this concept and assume right away that you are depriving yourself of things. Deprivation also takes a lot of will power. So even if someone thinks they can live with the deprivation, they are sure they’ll fail due to lack of will power.</p><p>I want to tell you that it’s completely wrong. There is no need for any will power what so ever (In fact, that’s a recipe for disaster but I digress. I’ll leave that for a later post). What it does take is a change in the state of mind. You must understand that having more does not mean being happier. That’s something that you must also internalize.</p><p>Internalizing this concept is beyond the scope of this article but it’s an absolute must. Once you do, everything else becomes so easy. It’s just so intuitive and second nature to dump the stuff you don’t use. And as you dump it, you clear the house, you lower your mental maintenance cost and you lower your anxiety level. This becomes a reinforcing loop.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you approach this from the view of deprivation, you’ll fail quickly. All you’ll see is all the things you’re missing while glossing over all the freedom you gained and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@osportfolio/how-to-make-life-better-71db900e82e3\">happiness by subtraction</a>.</p><p>My articles are rarely some sort of cohesive set of ideas that you can follow along with but I love how all these ideas from the FI community, minimalism, and happiness really overlap and come together so well. It proves to me once again that these are all correct. It’s sort of like science when you have a hypothesis about something and based on this hypothesis you keep seeing evidence in real life. It just makes your hypothesis that much more likely to be true.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1a3721e3abcf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">Minimalism and deprivation</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

They resonate with you so much you just feel inspired. They make you want to print it out as an inspirational poster and plaster it on every room in your house as a reminder. They are one of those great #LifeLessons.</p><p>I’ve had many of those moments. One in particular that I still refer to often is</p><blockquote>The sooner you do something, the longer you get to enjoy it</blockquote><p>I found this statement as part of another blog that I can’t remember anymore but it really resonated with me. I read it and realized that everything I’ve been delaying could be done right now and I’ll get so much more time to enjoy it.</p><p>It even lasted for a few days. But just life everything else in life, things got quickly in the way and I fell back to my old procrastinating habits. How could this be? Don’t I want to enjoy the outcome? Of course I do. But who ever said procrastination was logical in the first place.</p><p>Recently though, I’ve been experimenting with a whole new technique. The idea is very simple. Just do the smallest, littlest step you can to move things forward. For example, I have a garden that I wanted to build in my front yard for about a month now but I haven’t really done anything about it. I have a lot of great reasons as to why I haven’t done it. I come after work and it’s already dark. I have more pressing things to do. Etc.</p><p>So what’s the minimal step for me to get this going? Take out the shovel from the back of the house. That’s it. Nothing else. Next step tomorrow is to dig out one small portion of the grass. Nothing complicated and no back breaking work. It shouldn’t take more then a minute to do.</p><p>My guess is I won’t stop at one hole and I’ll continue for a while. Tomorrow we’ll see.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3d27fb4182e9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/getting-shit-done-3d27fb4182e9\">Getting shit done</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It will follow a slightly modified style of my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a> but will stick to the same principles as described <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-favourite-part-of-new-year-c043c0e69e97\">in my favourite part of new year</a>. One tweak that I’m attempting is to create a generic topic that I want to concentrate on (but not grade) and grade myself only on the action items.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>Let’s start with the big one. After all, it’s the most important thing you’ve got. This year, it’s also the most loaded category of resolutions.</p><ul><li><strong>Eat a big bowl of salad for lunch</strong></li></ul><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2F149sixr2mzlBrq%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F149sixr2mzlBrq%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F149sixr2mzlBrq%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy\" width=\"435\" height=\"244\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/23e83e127a952d1c2700aadbab20b5f6/href\">https://medium.com/media/23e83e127a952d1c2700aadbab20b5f6/href</a></iframe><p>I don’t expect to have any trouble with the above. I bought myself a nice big bowl of salad and I make sure to fill it up every day. I highly encourage everyone to eat their leafy greens.</p><ul><li><strong>Zero alcohol at home</strong></li><li><strong>Two drink limit during social gatherings</strong></li><li><strong>Intermittent fast 3 times a week</strong></li></ul><p>I think the details of how I do intermittent fasting is out of the scope of this article but the basic idea is restricted eating for 8 hours a day.</p><ul><li><strong>Limit coffee consumption to two cups a day</strong></li></ul><p>This makes me a little sad 😔. I love my coffee but I noticed that when I don’t have it, I start feeling very tired. I don’t like the idea of being dependent on a substance. Another option is try decaf or tea.</p><h3>Minimalism</h3><p>I couldn’t come up with more then one resolution for this category (appropriately). I think that since last year’s clean up, we’re pretty reasonable with how much things we accumulate. There’s certainly rooms that could use some re-evaluation but overall I can’t complain.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay item neutral</strong></li></ul><p>This one is short and easy. I’ll expand on item neutrality separately but the basic idea is simple. One item in, one item out.</p><h3>Reading</h3><p>Each book is someone’s lifetime accumulation of knowledge and experience condensed into a few hours of the most valuable lessons. It’s a great way to learn from gurus about any topic without ever having to meet them. Unfortunately I’m a slow a reader. Therefore; my goal isn’t anything super ambitious but definitely respectable.</p><ul><li><strong>Read 16 books in a year</strong></li></ul><p>I track my reading on Goodreads. That way I know exactly how many books I’ve read. Also, I don’t have to finish the book to count it. Some books are not very good but as long as I got through a significant portion of it I’ll add it to the count.</p><ul><li><strong>Replace unproductive activities with reading</strong></li></ul><p>Unproductive activities is quite broad but they tend to boil down to some sort of passive consumption of entertainment; things like TV, netflix, news, and tech websites.</p><h3>Fitness</h3><p>Unlike prior years, I didn’t wait until January to start going to the gym. Turns out, there’s a gym right in the building where I work so it’s extremely convenient. Also, I didn’t create any insurmountable goal. I found that consistency seems to be far more useful here than impressive ambitions.</p><ul><li><strong>Go to the gym twice a week</strong></li></ul><p>I have a simple exercise plan but it will probably fluctuate throughout the year. Mainly I’m focused on showing up at the gym. Once I’m there, lifting weights is the easy part.</p><h3>Mindfulness</h3><p>This is a completely new category for me. I tried a half-ass attempt at mindfulness earlier in 2017 but not ruminating about the past, planning for the future or recreating hypothetical events in your head, is harder to do then it first seems. I was introduced to the concept a while back but what really brought it to my attention is an honest account by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harris_%28journalist%29\">Dan Harris</a> on the path he took to start meditating.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0062265431/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062265431&amp;linkCode=am2&amp;tag=opensourcep0f-20&amp;linkId=105ef298c61e8862304dc4004f44a5f3\">Amazon.com: Buying Choices: 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works--A True Story</a></p><p>Since this is a new area for me, and I recognize how tough it is, I’m starting small for this year.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t pull out your phone without a reason</strong></li></ul><p>You stand in line at Trader Joe’s and you pull out your iPhone, slide the screens to the right, then to the left, check your email, and then put it back in your pocket. In the meantime achieving nothing. I see this all the time. Checking your phone for the sake of keeping your mind busy. I want to be okay with boredom.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay present during walks</strong></li></ul><p>I tend to walk a lot. I walk to work and to get groceries. I walk a minimum of 10,000 steps in a day. I don’t need 10,000 different conversations going through my head though. The idea is to try and stay present while outdoors. It’s somewhat arbitrary but I think it will be useful for two reasons. First, walking is a regular activity. Therefore; I’ll get a regular reminder to try and stay present. Second, the duration of the walks tends to be a reasonable amount of time for me to practice this new skill.</p><ul><li><strong>Stop doing two things at once</strong></li></ul><p>Mainly, I’m thinking about eating and browsing at the same time. Although I’m sure there’s plenty of other activities that I multi-task on. It seems like a great idea on the surface. You can finish twice as many things in the same time. However, I think it’s just another symptom of restlessness and the fear of boredom that infects us.</p><h3>Personal</h3><p>I generally like myself, but there’s one thing that really drives me crazy. I hate how I’m constantly late to meet people. It is so bad that our friends now expect us to show up late. It’s an inside joke to see if we show up on time or not. So my resolution for the year is simple.</p><ul><li><strong>Stop being late</strong></li></ul><p>I’m going to need some flexibility here. First, it’s culturally appropriate to be late. It’s even termed “fashionably late”. If that’s the expectation, I wouldn’t want to show up on time and surprise the hosts. Second, I cannot always control when we leave the house. If my wife isn’t ready, I don’t think she would appreciate me leaving the house without her. Therefore; as long as I am dressed and ready to go on time, I’ll consider that a win. It’s just a good habit to have.</p><p>That’s all for me for 2018. What do you think of these resolutions? Are they achievable and specific enough? Is there anything that I missed?</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8e10476e7640\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">Commitments for 2018</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Nothing unusual so far and that’s more or less what you’d expect people our age to talk about. It was a great night and it was nice to catch up with everyone. While talking specifically about children and inquiring about why anyone wanted them, one thing that was brought up very casually and without much resistance from the rest of the room was the idea that they will be there to teach you things. Sort of the way I do with my mom and you do with your mom and dad.</p><p>Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with learning from your kids. If my kid ends up being a surgeon, I would love to get her opinion about all sorts of health related issues. After all, she has medical training and I don’t. But despite their denial, that was not what my friends were trying to say at all. Instead, it was this underlying assumption that once you got old, you’re just not expected to perform well. Both mentally and physically. And it’s normal. If I was to challenge that idea, obviously they’d deny it but you could tell this was the assumption going into the conversation based on the context and where it was going.</p><p>I’m not going to pretend that once you hit 30, you are not less likely to make it to the NBA if you haven’t yet. There’s definitely diminishing physical abilities after a certain age (with very notable exceptions). But what bothers me is the lack of any sort of attempt to compensate for that. If you’re worried about your physical performance as you hit 50, why not double your gym time instead of just throwing your hands up in the air and say “that’s just the way it is”. I guarantee you there are people double my age who can bench press twice my weight. They just have a different attitude.</p><p>Similarly, I think that people that expect less mentally from older people, will expect less from themselves when their older. In turn, their abilities to understand and learn will quickly diminish with age. On the other hand, there’s older people who are still brilliant and who are able to maintain their mental clarity until their last day. What makes them so different? I think to some extent it’s their attitude.</p><p>That’s exactly the kind of attitude I want to cultivate in myself. I don’t think that when I’m 50 I’ll bench press less. I think I’ll bench press more. When I’m 50, I won’t be taking 10 pills a day. I’ll take none. I’ll feel great and I’m sure of it. I just need to make sure that I take care of myself now. This is the kind of attitude I would expect everyone to have.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=75eeecb3262\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/self-fulfilling-prophecies-75eeecb3262\">Self fulfilling prophecies</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>That’s really a bit of a stretch and a click bait because this isn’t really my first intermittent fasting (IF) experience. This is however, a description of my first 24 hour IF experience. And it was quite glorious I must admit.</p><p>For those that don’t know, IF is pretty simple. You just don’t eat. You do this on purpose and you do it for a short period of time. Pretty much what it sounds like. IF’s can last from 12 hours to a week. There’s no official time limits really. Also, they obviously include things like water.</p><p>There’s plenty of evidence that IF is exceptionally healthy for you. For example, it seems to promote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy\">autophagy</a> (which in itself sounds like a great thing). It also helps you <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-and-weight-loss\">lose weight</a>. It can help you <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193152441400200X\">reverse type II diabetes</a>. Finally, it can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17291990/\">reduce inflammation</a> in the body which is responsible for many chronic diseases such are heart disease and Alzheimer’s.</p><p>I’ve read a lot of opinions about IF and many people recommend it as a regular practice. One such notable case is my internet hero, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@drjasonfung\">Dr. Jason Fung</a>. However, I’ve never done a longer fast then 16 hours. The way I would usually do it is have my dinner by 8 pm and then skip breakfast and have lunch the next day at around 12 pm. That makes it exactly 16 hours.That was pretty much my daily routine for the last year or so.</p><p>On Monday, I’ve decided to step it up a notch and see how I would feel if I went a full 24 hours. To do that, I had to skip one additional meal. Dinner had to go. I must admit that I was a little nervous at first. What if I get hungry? My brain would scream at me. I might even pass out from starvation (unlikely).</p><p>What really helped was that my wife was on board with this idea. In fact, like many of my great ideas, it was really her idea. And I wasn’t going to let her down. So like the good partner that I am, I had a huge lunch that day and went cold turkey. So far nothing special. There are a few more hours to dinner time.</p><p>Unfortunately, my wife changed her mind and decided that IF on that day was just not for her. So she decided to cook dinner. The sunken cost fallacy really kicked into high gear here and I just couldn’t give up. I went too far and wanted to try this so bad I figured I can manage without dinner. As a side note, I wasn’t even hungry come dinner time. But you know how it is when you see other people eat.</p><p>This was pretty much the hardest part of my experience. I’ve managed skip dinner while watching others eat. The rest was a total breeze. In the morning I had a black coffee and by lunch time I still wasn’t hungry. In fact it was amazing. I haven’t had a drop of food for 24 hours but my body wasn’t falling apart. It was a wonderful experience actually.</p><p>Now, an entire week has almost passed and I’m thinking back to Monday, I realize that this could definitely become a new habit of mine. And why not? It seems to be good for you. It makes perfect sense from an evolutionary points of view. My internet heroes are claiming it’s amazing. And it’s damn easy.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3a7cd7f7d229\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/first-intermittent-fasting-experience-3a7cd7f7d229\">First intermittent fasting experience</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Something clicked today that I should have realized much earlier. Nothing groundbreaking and earth shattering like my usual rants but still an interesting realization. I was always under the impression that each time I cheated and had an “improper” meal, I was breaking my diet and forcing my body to restart the entire process of fat adaptation.</p><p>Subconsciously, each time I had a bowl of rice at a restaurant or some sort of dessert that a friend baked, I thought to myself that it will be another few days to get back on track. On top of it, I fully expected to see it reflected on the scale and by the very scientific pinch test.</p><p>Nothing was further from reality. In fact, most of the time, I saw absolutely no change what so ever. Now, in hindsight, it is ridiculous to think that one bad meal or even one bad day could really cause any noticeable weight gain but there is also a slightly deeper insight. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.tuitnutrition.com/2016/01/dont-be-a-ketard1.html\">Amy Berger</a> I realized the difference between being fat adapted and being in ketosis. More importantly, I realized that just because you cheated, does not mean you’re suddenly not fat adapted.</p><p>Let’s start with an example. if you’re a typical SAD (standard American diet) consumer, eating tons of refined wheat flour, you are probably well tuned to convert glucose to energy. All the right enzymes are in place. This is your default mode and it seems to work okay for you. If you were to eat a meal high in fat but low in carbs at this point, you’d probably feel pretty cranky. Of course there’s an exact parallel to being tuned to eating and using fat for energy.</p><p>So what happens if you all of a sudden decide to cut the carbs from your high carb diet? Your body cannot get it’s energy nearly as efficiently anymore and it freaks out. It needs time to develop and express the enzymes related to oxidizing fat for energy. That helps explain why some people experience the so called “carb flu” when first switching to a low carb diet.</p><p>But my point is that this process is never an overnight event. It takes time to switch an adapt to a new form of energy. You are very likely to still be a fat burning machine the next day. Therefore; there’s worse things that you can do to your diet then once in a while having a bowl of rice.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2f4375142a09\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/worse-than-a-cheat-meal-2f4375142a09\">Worse than a cheat meal</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I don’t think they are necessarily looking for a comprehensive explanation of how insulin is related to heart disease but a simple list of dos and don’ts. This should hopefully clarify my current standing.</p><p>Let’s start with the don’ts.</p><ol><li>If you’re consuming sugar then stop. It’s just bad for you. Throw it out or burn it. Up to you.</li><li>Cut out all the grain and legume products from your diet. That includes rye, quinoa barley and buckwheat. I’m sure you eat a ton of that don’t you? Oh yeah, and wheat. That includes pasta and bread, whole wheat, whole grain, ancient grain and white. Sorry.</li><li>Stop eating low fat garbage (Anything meant to be full fat but is low fat is defined as garbage).</li><li>Eliminate vegetable oils from your diet. That includes common ones like Canola, soy, and safflower.</li></ol><p>And now the dos</p><ol><li>Replace all the foods you’ve eliminated so far with vegetables. That includes a lot of leafy greens.</li><li>Replace eliminated oils with olive, coconut, or avocado oils.</li></ol><p>That’s about it. Pretty easy right?</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7f61ec8231b8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-should-you-eat-7f61ec8231b8\">What should you eat</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s our obsessive over consumption of sugar and refined carbohydrates.</p><p>Now, despite some resistance from the dark vegan armies, I’m pretty sure it’s obvious that diabetes and over consumption of sugar is closely related. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it’s a root cause of our exploding rate of type II diabetes. It makes perfect sense yet still remains controversial and unresolved.</p><p>Next we move on to heart disease. The number one killer in the world. That one I admit is a little more complicated but still I would implicate sugar as the cause. Studies in this space tend to be observational so there are no hard proofs but a lot of things seem to be aligning. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983261\">insulin resistance and heart disease are closely related</a>.</p><p>Now for some stretch goals. First, there’s cancer. I’m going based of this video but seems damn convincing to me.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSEE-oU8_NSU%3Fstart%3D2599%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D2599&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSEE-oU8_NSU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSEE-oU8_NSU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3d34be985deea66754cd2167f3c2e46e/href\">https://medium.com/media/3d34be985deea66754cd2167f3c2e46e/href</a></iframe><p>If a cancer cell requires abnormal amounts of glucose and we don’t provide it, it should starve. If we feed it, its growth should be promoted. Makes perfect sense.</p><p>And finally there’s this whole discussion on Alzheimer’s being <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.co.uk/type3-diabetes.html\">type 3 diabetes.</a> Which is again just an implication of sugar being the root cause. This is again pretty early on and light on true detailed studies but it makes sense considering you bought the above.</p><p>So having said this, what do we have as a treatment option? Easy, stop eating sugar and cut down your carbohydrate consumption.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a6d827503143\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/its-all-about-the-sugar-a6d827503143\">It’s all about the sugar</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

She is a wonderful woman in her 60’s. Unfortunately, she lost her husband to brain cancer a few years back. Since then she’s been living alone in a condo close by to my parents. They see each other quite often and have a great relationship.</p><p>I saw her the other day and wanted to use the opportunity to ask her some questions regarding diabetes. I wanted to ask her about the medication she takes and the difficulties she faces. To be honest, I also secretly wanted to let her know about <a href=\"https://idmprogram.com/\">Dr. Jason Fung</a> and how he reverses diabetes (He’s one of my online heroes).</p><p>To my surprise, when I brought up his treatment program, she cut me off and refused to listen. I was surprised (to put it mildly). “Why would you not want to know” I asked her? He literally reverses diabetes in his patients. How could anyone refuse that?</p><p>Her explanation was quite thought provoking. She told me that in all honesty, she doesn’t know how long she has to live. She doesn’t want to spend her last remaining years fasting, and worrying about everything she eats. She wants to be able to go out and have a good time. If she was 20 years younger and her husband was still around, things would probably be different.</p><p>Now, to be clear, I fundamentally disagree with her. I think she has it completely backwards. By taking care of her health, she could live her remaining days well and truly enjoy them. Also, most likely, she’ll have more of them to enjoy.</p><p>But then I started wondering if she was right too. Was I only saying this because I am half her age.

Effectively, this means that the interest is paid using pretax dollars. Great! let’s all go buy houses.</p><p>Not so fast. Take anyone with any sort of economic sense and they will tell you there is no free lunch here. You’re not getting stuff cheaper. By subsidizing the payments, the government simply pushed the prices of housing up for everyone. If you don’t believe me, answer this question: What do you think would happen if this was taken away now? If you said people would freak out and the prices would fall because payments are higher then reverse this argument.</p><p>Alright, so we know governments generally can’t get shit right and a lot of policies are misguided. Does that mean this one is also just a big fat waste of money? That’s sort of what I thought. At least until yesterday. Yesterday, I watched this video:</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtYWhdzYnjmc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtYWhdzYnjmc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtYWhdzYnjmc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/296303c6842968504378b9460fdbbc9e/href\">https://medium.com/media/296303c6842968504378b9460fdbbc9e/href</a></iframe><p>There were a couple of interesting points of conversation there. One in particular that caught my attention though was regarding this exact topic and your level of taxation. You see, since every owner gets to take advantage of this particular piece of policy, they save at the same rate as their marginal tax rate. On the other hand, the amount that this house went up in price due to this particular policy is roughly equal to the overall average marginal tax rate in the United States.</p><p>So what does that mean? That means that if you are at a higher margin tax rate then the average population, you’d save money based on this policy. If you’re in a lower tax bracket, you lose. The only additional point I’d like to make is that it is probably the average margin tax rate of an average house buyer. The poorest citizens probably keep renting.</p><blockquote>So this entire policy is not only making housing more expensive for everyone, but it is oddly also a subsidy for the rich by the poor.</blockquote><p>I’m not talking about tax cuts here that are great for everyone but happen to benefit the rich more (due to their larger tax bill in the first place). This is literally a transfer from the poor to the rich.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=44c2f845876\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/mortgage-interest-deduction-lies-44c2f845876\">Mortgage interest deduction lies</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Anecdotal evidence about multiple bids on some broken down shitty houses with no pictures on RedFin and how many hundreds of thousands over asking the house down the street sold for dominate.</p><p>This in turn tends to drive the renters between us to go on a buying frenzy, desperately looking for a house, any house to buy. Because you know… if you don’t buy today, you’ll be priced out forever. I know I’ve heard that many times; including here in Seattle.</p><p>The same people always bring up the same examples. Look at San Francisco they say. Seattle (or insert the city that you live in) is the next San Francisco. “If I bought ten years ago I could have retired today”.</p><p>So here’s my contrarian theory. Now this probably doesn’t apply in all cases 100% of the time. But, ask yourself this:</p><blockquote>Were you ever priced in to the city in the first place?</blockquote><p>For example, San Francisco has always been more expensive then Seattle by about a <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/will-seattle-really-become-the-next-san-francisco/\">factor of two</a>. If you happened to be the age that you are now, working in San Francisco a decade ago, could you afford it then? Keep in mind that it’s very unlikely your salary would be the same.</p><p>I’m not just talking about inflation. I’m thinking more broadly like what industry you’re in. Are you in tech or nursing? You’re probably making way more money then you could a decade ago. These jobs are simply in higher demands now.</p><p>So when your Grandpa reminds you how he bought this house for 60k, don’t forget to ask him how much he was earning per hour. It could make a lot of difference. Now, if you couldn’t buy it then and you can’t buy it now does not mean you shouldn’t strive for it. I am just suggesting that we should keep this in mind when complaining about the state of affordability and how Amazon “ruined” everything.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a7d996fd0f49\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/being-priced-out-a7d996fd0f49\">Being priced out</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>A friend just revealed that he bought himself a new house. Due to local social norms, I pretended to be ecstatic and requested to see the house. He pulled out his phone and showed me some pictures. To my horror, this is a 4 bedroom 4 bathroom house for him and his wife.</p><p>Now, I know better than to question this decision. Especially after he already bought it. But thankfully he brought it up himself. He told me that the reason he needed such a large house is because occasionally his parents and his wife’s parents like to visit. That’s definitely a noble reason.</p><p>On the other hand, there’s the other 49 weeks of the year when you live there just you and your wife. Even if you pop out twins in the next 9 months, you still have one extra bedroom. Of course most self respecting North American would then turn that into an “Office”. You know, like that room many households have that no one goes into.</p><p>Great! Another wise financial decision. Now what about the maintenance? What about the taxes on the property? What about the bills? What about not being able to find your wife because your house is too big? Why is it such a desirable status of success?</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aaec7b57c872\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/big-houses-aaec7b57c872\">Big houses</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Effectively, this means that the interest is paid using pretax dollars. Great! let’s all go buy houses.</p><p>Not so fast. Take anyone with any sort of economic sense and they will tell you there is no free lunch here. You’re not getting stuff cheaper. By subsidizing the payments, the government simply pushed the prices of housing up for everyone. If you don’t believe me, answer this question: What do you think would happen if this was taken away now? If you said people would freak out and the prices would fall because payments are higher then reverse this argument.</p><p>Alright, so we know governments generally can’t get shit right and a lot of policies are misguided. Does that mean this one is also just a big fat waste of money? That’s sort of what I thought. At least until yesterday. Yesterday, I watched this video:</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtYWhdzYnjmc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtYWhdzYnjmc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtYWhdzYnjmc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/296303c6842968504378b9460fdbbc9e/href\">https://medium.com/media/296303c6842968504378b9460fdbbc9e/href</a></iframe><p>There were a couple of interesting points of conversation there. One in particular that caught my attention though was regarding this exact topic and your level of taxation. You see, since every owner gets to take advantage of this particular piece of policy, they save at the same rate as their marginal tax rate. On the other hand, the amount that this house went up in price due to this particular policy is roughly equal to the overall average marginal tax rate in the United States.</p><p>So what does that mean? That means that if you are at a higher margin tax rate then the average population, you’d save money based on this policy. If you’re in a lower tax bracket, you lose. The only additional point I’d like to make is that it is probably the average margin tax rate of an average house buyer. The poorest citizens probably keep renting.</p><blockquote>So this entire policy is not only making housing more expensive for everyone, but it is oddly also a subsidy for the rich by the poor.</blockquote><p>I’m not talking about tax cuts here that are great for everyone but happen to benefit the rich more (due to their larger tax bill in the first place). This is literally a transfer from the poor to the rich.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=44c2f845876\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/mortgage-interest-deduction-lies-44c2f845876\">Mortgage interest deduction lies</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

They resonate with you so much you just feel inspired. They make you want to print it out as an inspirational poster and plaster it on every room in your house as a reminder. They are one of those great #LifeLessons.</p><p>I’ve had many of those moments. One in particular that I still refer to often is</p><blockquote>The sooner you do something, the longer you get to enjoy it</blockquote><p>I found this statement as part of another blog that I can’t remember anymore but it really resonated with me. I read it and realized that everything I’ve been delaying could be done right now and I’ll get so much more time to enjoy it.</p><p>It even lasted for a few days. But just life everything else in life, things got quickly in the way and I fell back to my old procrastinating habits. How could this be? Don’t I want to enjoy the outcome? Of course I do. But who ever said procrastination was logical in the first place.</p><p>Recently though, I’ve been experimenting with a whole new technique. The idea is very simple. Just do the smallest, littlest step you can to move things forward. For example, I have a garden that I wanted to build in my front yard for about a month now but I haven’t really done anything about it. I have a lot of great reasons as to why I haven’t done it. I come after work and it’s already dark. I have more pressing things to do. Etc.</p><p>So what’s the minimal step for me to get this going? Take out the shovel from the back of the house. That’s it. Nothing else. Next step tomorrow is to dig out one small portion of the grass. Nothing complicated and no back breaking work. It shouldn’t take more then a minute to do.</p><p>My guess is I won’t stop at one hole and I’ll continue for a while. Tomorrow we’ll see.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3d27fb4182e9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/getting-shit-done-3d27fb4182e9\">Getting shit done</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

But most importantly, most people are simply not ready to hear it.</p><p>Now, when I say most I really mean most. Some people, given the right topic at the right time, will not only listen to everything I have to say, but ask follow up questions. This is a strong signal that they do care.

I flew over on Thursday and planning to stay until Monday morning. The plan is to have a surprise birthday party. My mom is making all the arrangements and it’s growing to be quite the headache with all the details but I’m sure he’s going to love it.</p><p>One thing did stand out to me though. My mom was going over some of the planning and casually mentioned that for my dad’s 50th birthday, I made him a really great montage. Everyone at his birthday loved it and since then it’s been a tradition to have one at all of their friends milestones. However, she said that for this one, it wasn’t really necessary.</p><p>Naturally, I inquired as to why she thought so and she explained that although it’s been a decade since the last video, she feels like this video would be essentially the same. “Not much has changed” was her exact quote. There was basically nothing worthy to show people.</p><p>This bothers me for several reasons. First and foremost, it bothers me because I feel sad for them. I feel like you let an entire decade slip by and haven’t even done enough with it to share the highlights with the people closest to you.</p><p>Second, the days the I do nothing tend to be the days that are least memorable (naturally). I would imagine that there is probably a similar effect to weeks, months, years and decades. You can live your entire life without doing much at all.</p><p>Finally, I was angry. I was angry because I can’t understand how she wasn’t bothered by it. Why is it okay in her mind to have your life pass you by. Of course based on my “Don’t be an asshole rule” I didn’t say any of this and I doubt she’ll ever read it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=69e6e56237b6\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-not-to-live-your-life-69e6e56237b6\">How not to live your life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

He just started university and had all these questions about expectations. I, as the “mature” adult tried to provide him with some pointers. Of course, I tried to keep it honest as well. I don’t think anyone wants to hear generic, meaningless, motivational quotes. I know I don’t.</p><p>I wanted to provide him with something useful and applicable. Most importantly, I wanted it to resonate with him. There was only one thing I could think of to say. I first admitted that I wasn’t a very good student. I didn’t study much and I crammed for exams. I learned just enough to do okay but would forget most of it the second I walked out of that exam room.</p><p>I also mentioned that he will probably feel the need to do the same. That’s just how people do it in university. It just doesn’t have to be the only way. Another way to look at it is you are spending your hard earned money to be there. We’ve also determined previously that money = time. If you’re going to spend your time on something, make sure it’s worth it. It’s a finite resource after all.</p><p>I didn’t dive too deep into the finite resource portion because that might not resonate as well with a 21 year old but the rest is true. No one likes to just waste their time. Therefore; if you’re going somewhere, make sure you get the most out of it.

For me, it all started a three weeks back. Up until that point, I thought very little about my toilet (as I should). My most memorable recollection was installing a soft close cover on it so it wouldn’t bang when I put the seat down. Otherwise, it was just like every other toilet — white, round and a great place to browse your phone.</p><p>So what lessons could I possibly learn from this familiar household item? Allow me to offer the following <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=allegory\">allegory</a>.</p><p>As many of you know, I dabble in a some <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">house hacking</a>. I rent out my basement on Airbnb to random people on the internet. On Sunday I got the following lovely message from my guests: “the toilet isn’t flushing”. Thankfully, there was nothing in there I couldn’t handle. I headed downstairs, pulled out the plunger and started plunging vigorously. I plunged for about an hour. I tried all sorts of techniques. I put hot water in there. I put soap in there. I ended up with a bowl full of hot soapy bubbles. Eventually, I had to admit that I needed professional help.</p><p>I called the first plumber I could find on Google. He showed up within a few hours looking ready to unclog some pipes. He started with the auger (long wire you stuff in the toilet). He stuck it in there, rotated it a bunch of times but no luck. He removed the toilet off the floor and tried again. Still no luck. All I could think was “What the hell did those hippies flush down my toilet?”.</p><p>He mentioned we’re going to need some more heavy duty equipment. Keep in mind that I have Airbnb guests in my house with a dysfunctional toilet. They are not going to be very happy. On top of it, I live in an old house. Our pipes are… questionable. How much is this going to cost me? I am now quite nervous.</p><p>We brought down a 400 pound roll of metallic tubing. He stuck it in the pipe and started unwinding it in. He kept going all the way to the end. When he pulled it out, we found an extension cord wrapped around the metallic tubing.</p><p>As we both stood there scratching our heads wondering how this is even possible, my wife was still thinking straight. She Googled it quickly and identified it as a part of our sewage pump. Turns out if your toilet is below the sewage line, you need a pump to get the waste out (makes sense once you think about it). The plumber must have ripped off the cord while digging for clogs.</p><p>He put the toilet back in place; Charged me $350; told me I need to get a qualified professional and bounced.</p><p>I started to frantically call anyone who could possibly help. I needed this done ASAP. We have paying customers in the house who need to … use the facilities. The best I could do is get a guy to show up in two days. The estimate for a replacement was $1600.</p><p>I don’t know if you’ve ever dealt with plumbers, electricians or any general maintenance workers but they aren’t exactly known for being reliable.</p><p>That night, I couldn’t sleep. I was worried the plumber wouldn’t show; replacing the pump wouldn’t fix the issue; or that it would escalate to more problems. I woke up the next day with a big headache — exhausted and stressed.</p><p>On a whim, I decided to call the initial company and complain about the plumber; maybe they’ll offer me a discount. I dialed their number, and politely explained what happened. Instead of a discount, they offered to fix the pump for free. Another plumber showed up later in the day, replaced the pump within an hour and charged me nothing for labour and material.</p><p>Once he finished, I rushed downstairs and started flushing that toilet over and over. Flushing never felt so good. The next night, I slept like a baby. I don’t remember the last time I slept that well. I woke up refreshed, feeling great, ready to take on the world.</p><p>What really inspired this story is how vividly I remember the difference in those two days. When the toilet was broken and everything seemed like an endless series of disasters, life was hard — I was stressed and miserable. Dealing with this shit (pun intended) was not fun. Once the toilet service was restored, my life was turned upside down. I felt free. I felt good. I felt like anything was possible. In short life was glorious again. What a difference 24 hours can do for your well being.</p><p>More importantly, I recognized how much we take for granted. As long as this toilet was working, I never paid attention to it. I pulled the lever down. The water flushed away all my troubles. Life went on. However, once this process failed, my outlook changed. All of a sudden my house wasn’t this impenetrable castle but a money pit. And running that Airbnb wasn’t a license to print money but just a bunch of hassles.</p><p>Granted, I did not feel like that for long. Once everything was fixed and settled, I was more than happy to take my guests’ money for the right to stay in my basement (I did offer a free night for the trouble). Also, I ended up getting a brand new sewage pump installed for a bargain price.</p><p>Upon reflection, I had to ask myself the following question:</p><blockquote>What can I do to experience life like I did on Monday, everyday?</blockquote><p>In other words, how can I wake up feeling refreshed and energized, all worries alleviated and the anxiety extinguished. Turns out my experience that week is a common phenomena encountered regularly. In fact, we even have an aphorism to explain what happened:</p><blockquote>“You don’t know what you have until it’s gone”</blockquote><p>Duh. Everyone knows that. But what can we do about it?</p><p>One thing I could do is sabotage my plumbing on regular basis and deal with the plumber while my Airbnb guests are watching. I don’t think it’s a scalable solution though so I wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p>Another option is to practice what is usually referred to as “gratitude journaling”. <a href=\"http://thehowofhappiness.com/\">Sonja Lyubomirsky</a> talks extensively about this technique in her book, “The how of happiness”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Happiness-Approach-Getting-Life/dp/0143114956/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535605491&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+how+of+happiness\">The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want</a></p><p>It entails taking two minutes out of your day (or week) to write down 3 things you’re thankful for. It can be anything. It can be as mundane as catching the bus on time or as significant as getting promoted at work or as pivotal as getting engaged. The key to this exercise is to regularly consider all the things you’re thankful for and consciously become a more grateful person.</p><p>I’ve known about this method for years. Yet somehow, this spiritual, new age approach never resonated with me. I would imagine people sitting in a circle, humming, holding their energy crystals with one hand and writing in their journals made of recycled fabrics with the other.</p><p>If the above doesn’t appeal to you, feel free to drop all the spiritual moonshine and concentrate on the psychological benefits. The root act is simple. Think about what you’re thankful for; be grateful, write it down. Repeat tomorrow.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ba883a11224c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-flushing-the-toilet-made-me-appreciate-the-little-things-in-life-ba883a11224c\">How flushing the toilet made me appreciate the little things in life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Hashtags were flying around with snazzy slogans celebrating unity and harmony, identity and integrity and all sorts of other hippy war cries. We got to talk about the company’s future direction and gossip about internal politics.</p><p>Once each day came to a close, we headed to the restaurants to eat the finest Pad Thai San Francisco had to offer.

I’ll take that beer now.</p><p>Once the party was over, I stumbled my way to the hotel and passed out.</p><p>The next day I woke up at 10am with a pounding headache. I was incapacitated to my room for the next 9 hours while my liver was hard at work. The only positive outcome of that experience was the opportunity to reflect on my actions.</p><p>I am the guy who preaches the gospel of low sugar diets to anyone who will dare to listen. I spend copious amounts of time roaming the internet for information about insulin, cholesterol, and inflammation. I also managed to poison my own body using exclusively the sheer power of my own will.</p><p>I am the guy who regularly writes about happiness, minimalism and intentional living. I worked hard on my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a> to use my time wisely. I found plenty of time to browse nonsense on the internet throughout that week. I did not however find time to call my mother.</p><p>If the statement above is true — if actions dictate your values — my values are… off. They are certainly not what I expected them to be.</p><p>I am glad Colin brought up that phrase. Thanks to him, I had a mini-epiphany while nursing my hangover.</p><p>Up to last week, my <strong>values</strong> dictated my <strong>actions </strong>— up to a point. Occasionally, I would give myself a break from being good … and be bad. I would drink a little too much. I would browse YouTube a little too long. I would get into an argument on Twitter a little too fast.</p><p>The new me prefaces these “undesirable” behaviours with the following question:</p><blockquote>Does this action reflect my values?</blockquote><p>Does drinking a pint of beer reflect my values? Nope. Maybe I’ll think again before ordering a second round. Better yet, I can go for a tall glass of kombucha instead.</p><p>This approach can work for anyone. Try this:</p><p>Next time you’re about to open Netflix, play another round of Candy Crush or skip the gym because you are sore from the brisk walk yesterday, ask yourself this: <strong>does this action reflect my values?</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">2018 resolutions</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f40b49020bee\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/if-actions-reflect-values-what-does-it-say-about-you-f40b49020bee\">If actions reflect values, what do they say about you?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Everything is attentively dusted and meticulously arranged. The sink is empty of all dishes. The oven is pre-heating that delicious pot roast. And of course, there’s figs and pistachios neatly laid out in beautiful bowls on the dining table to tie us over until dinner is served.</p><p>In turn, when we invite those friends over, there’s a certain level of underlying obligation to live up to those expectations. If our friends had figs and pistachios, we must have cranberries and walnuts ready for them. If they had a perfectly arranged kitchen cabinet, we must do the same. We certainly cannot afford to wear our comfortable home clothes — we must dress up.</p><p>Of course, this friendly race to outdo each other does not come for free. It actually takes a heavy toll on us. We cannot simply allow to have people over. We must clear up our entire day to do all the cleaning and cooking and shopping and planning. It’s exhausting. Hosting people turned from being a pleasurable bonding activity to a major inconvenience. We end up thinking twice before inviting anyone.</p><p>Here’s what I propose (technically it’s my wife’s idea. Giving credit where it’s due): I propose that we stop putting up these facades to hide behind. We all know that everyone’s houses are a mess when no one is looking. We all know that your fridge isn’t always stocked full of goodies just ready to eat. And you know what? That’s okay.</p><p>This idea makes most millennial aged individuals very nervous for two reasons.</p><ol><li>It will expose things that no one knows about them expect their spouse. However, we don’t have to make it extreme. Take for example the 30 minute warning approach: If you’ll be in the neighborhood, call your potential host 30 minutes ahead of your arrival. That gives them just enough time to pick up their socks off the floor and close the bedroom door.</li><li>As a guest, you also tend to feel awkward about dropping in suddenly. What if they are busy? What if they don’t want to see me? What if ….? I think this reluctance stems from years of being accustomed to all these obligations when you are hosting. In turn, when other people are hosting, you don’t want to impose. These feelings are perfectly reasonable but we must break out of the cycle of doubt.</li></ol><p>Implementing this approach in our day to day lives is easy. All we have to do is tell each other that it’s okay. <strong>It’s okay to just drop by</strong>.</p><p>Naturally, when adopting this, there are three caveats I must mention:</p><ul><li>Make sure your host is home (duh).</li><li>Make sure your host is free. If they are busy, don’t assume it’s an attack on your character. They just have things to do.</li><li>Know your limits. The idea is not to spend your entire Saturday at someone’s house.</li></ul><p>The idea is inspired by observing my own parents and their huge circle of friends. They constantly seem to have people over but they are never particularly stressed out about it. It’s not uncommon to have 3 different sets of people show up throughout the day. They are usually served a cup of tea and whatever they can find available in the fridge.</p><p>This is sort of how I imagine people living in those small European towns in Greece where everyone is old and happy and all they do is socialize. I want to be old and happy too!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=651c5adacc26\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/proposal-dropping-in-on-people-is-not-the-worst-thing-ever-651c5adacc26\">Proposal: dropping in on people is not the worst thing ever</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It is clear that earning fulfillment along the way is as important as reaching to the end goal. A friend asked me a very important question: <em>how do we enjoy every moment while still having a sense of a future goal? </em>I think of it this way:</p><blockquote><strong>Completion of a big goal = SUM(small daily action)</strong></blockquote><p>For example, my goal to write a book is far-fetch and has always been postponed. Writing one page every week (for 3 years) actually seems more achievable! The only way to get myself to write repeatedly is to <em>build the habit around it.</em></p><h3><strong>Deliberately building habits</strong></h3><p>My favorite book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526875534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit\">Power of Habit</a> suggests that any habit consists of 3 parts.</p><blockquote>First, there is a <strong>cue</strong>, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the <strong>routine</strong>, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a <strong>reward</strong>, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop… becomes more and more automatic<em>.</em></blockquote><p>Defining the cue is crucial. What worked best for me is to select a specific time, location, and vibe all together as a cue. I pick my favorite instrumental music, and sit on the couch on Sunday morning to get my brain engaged. I do my writing routine. Then I publish it to get the readers’ feedback as a reward. It gets easier over time as the habit is formed.</p><p>Majority of the time, I forget about the overarching goal and mostly enjoy doing my routine.<strong> The right set of habits can maximize your sense of fulfillment while still keeping you on track for the long term achievement.</strong></p><h3>Replacing bad habits</h3><p>Now that we know what is the good habits to keep or create, it’s time to get rid of the not-so-good habits. The best way is to replace the routine.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Keeping the same cue and reward; substituting the routine.</em></strong></blockquote><p>Say I want to stop checking social media first thing in the morning. First, I must identify the cue and the reward. I know the cue is the sound of the alarm clock, and the reward is the feeling of being awake afterwards. I choose to replace social media with reading (since it contributes to my long term goal). I delete the social media apps and replace them with reading apps. It feel a bit different at first, but overtime, the brain gets the same reward and it adjusts to the change. This strategy works all the time as long as you understand your cue and reward.</p><p>Identifying a good habit and deliberately replacing the bad ones is a continuous process. Overtime, I come to a set of habits that I do daily.</p><h3><strong>Realize enemy of habits</strong></h3><p>Life can’t be all planned. Many times, the unplanned events must override the schedule and break your flow. It can even break the yearly habit in a day. Spontaneous habit changes must happen to match the circumstances. This is perhaps the most difficult part about operating life on a set of habits.</p><blockquote><strong>The best way to cope with change is to be self-aware, constantly reflecting upon the self and understanding our own desire.</strong></blockquote><p>Being self-aware also helps with reinforcing the habit consciously when the cues or rewards are missing. It’s a fallback mechanism to maintain a long lasting habit.</p><h3>Super Habit</h3><p>Like any other goal, self-awareness can be practiced and strengthened. I found the <strong>habit of meditation </strong>to contribute highly to self-awareness. The mind is just like the body. It needs to be well-maintained and exercised.</p><p>Meditation gives the mind a chance to reorganize all the information. It is also a practice to de-focus on the past and future, and re-focus on what happens in the present. With higher consciousness, the mind is sharpened to understand and deal with uncertainty in life better.</p><p>I would denote meditation as my super habit because it keeps all other habits together. (I will write more about this later!)</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I believe that the better the plan, the easier the execution. <em>The journey to complete your big goal must be thought through</em>. Building good set of habits and maintain them is the fastest way to get there.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6cf095b2eacd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">How I build the right set of habits</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, my perfectionist wife has been setting up the room for a month prior to that. The possibility of someone giving us a three star rating is just too much to bear. Thankfully, we’ve been getting only five star ratings so far.</p><p>To ensure the five star rating keeps coming, we’ve had to go through each corner of the basement and clear it out, rearrange the furniture and fix any outstanding nagging maintenance issues. As a result, we’ve taken several trunk-loads of stuff straight to Goodwill — mostly random junk that was packed away in the basement, forgotten about and collecting dust.</p><p>The basement was also the place where our TV lived. We do not have another one upstairs. It is also the place where I kept my clothes. My wife graciously allowed me to keep my stuff in the basement while she took over the bedroom closet. It incorporated my own private bathroom as well. We’ve never had to worry where to keep my shaving paraphernalia versus her hair products.</p><p>Since we’ve started renting the basement, things had to change. We’ve shifted from having 1600 square feet to 900. My clothes moved upstairs. We’ve had to isolate a small corner in the closet for me. The bathrooms were unified (it is going through a clean up process as I am writing this). There’s also no more television.</p><blockquote>Essentially, we’ve forced ourselves into adopting a certain level of minimalism.</blockquote><p>Minimalism was never the intention when considering Airbnb. Instead, I was always thinking about our TTF (time to financial independence). That’s because Airbnb is the classic example of passivish income (I made that up). Your existing asset (the house) is doing most of the heavy lifting. You just need to remember to pay the bills. The more you automate, the more passive it becomes.</p><p>One glance around here and you’ll know right away that I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">minimalism</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/tagged/intentional-living\">intentional living</a>. That’s why it came to me as a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise when I realized I am forced to downsize substantially.</p><p>Before you jump to conclusions, this is not some personality disorder or twisted reasoning. I am not actively trying to induce self-harm. This is a very conscious decision. Ponder this idea of <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/\">happiness through subtraction</a> for example to see where I’m coming from. If you’re still not convinced, that’s fine. I’ll have a lot more to say about minimalism in the future.</p><p>In the mean time, for anyone thinking about their TTF, you should know there are some unintended consequences to Airbnb that go well beyond the money; intentional minimalism happens to be one of them.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=53c7a6122982\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">Surprising unintended consequences of Airbnb hosting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Everyone is always trying to change something about themselves. The typical things includes the food they eat, the amount of exercise they get, how they spend their time and how they prioritize their lives. Turns out, change is harder than reading a blog online.</p><p>People are also creatures of habit. We all have our morning routines, our night routines, our commute to work routine and the web sites we visit on our lunch break routine. In fact, when we are put in new environments where executing our routines is hard, we generally tend to skip workouts and eat fried chicken for dinner.</p><p>I am going to share with you an approach that I use to form better habits. It is not fool proof. It does require some upfront investment. However, I believe it could work for almost any habit you are trying to form as long as you apply enough creativity. The system is very simple to apply. All you have to do is <em>create a system. </em>Yes, you read that right, the system is to create systems. Let me explain.</p><p>When I say “system”, I’m talking about a set of rules, or guidelines you use to guide your choices. The side effect of those rules should be that you execute your desired habit. Think of these rules as formalizing a contract with yourself. The contract has at least one rule: <em>I can have as much [A] as I want. However, before I get [A], I must do [B]</em>. This is what I call a personal contract.</p><p>The inspiration came from <a href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\">Dr. BJ Fogg</a>, a researcher in behaviour design who had a great TED talk a few years back about this exact topic.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%3Fstart%3D689%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D689&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAdKUJxjn-R8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href\">https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href</a></iframe><blockquote>If you use an existing behaviour in your life, and you put the new, tiny behaviour <em>after </em>it, you can use the existing behaviour to be the trigger.</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, over time, I noticed that simply defining the contract wasn’t always enough. Frequently, I couldn’t uphold the contract for long or I would completely forget about it. In fact, it was really a hit or miss — occasionally it would work really well but periodically it would completely fall apart.</p><p>More recently, I took a look at some personal contracts I was able to maintain for a long stretch and tried to boil it down to what made them different. I have identified four hallmarks of a good personal contract.</p><p><strong>Automatic.</strong> If you can set this up for your desired habit, your job is practically done. For example, before I spend any money, I max out my 401k. I can automate this through my paycheque contributions. Done!</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to automate certain areas of your life. Exercising effectively requires you to be doing exercise. Calling your mom once a week requires you to talk (at least for now).</p><p>However, there’s a clear subset of bad habits that can be automated away. Anything digital will naturally fall here. Do you have bad browsing behaviour? Are you spending too much time on your Twitter/Facebook/YouTube ? There’s an app for that. Are you having trouble saving or budgeting? There’s a bank for that.</p><p>The advantage of automating bad habits away is you only have that upfront cost once but you reap the dividends indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Breaks down barriers. </strong>One habit that I recently found to be absolutely effortless is the habit of eating a healthy lunch. In the past, I’ve tried cooking at home or buying out healthy lunches but inevitably you skip cooking for a few nights and end up ordering a large barbacoa burrito at Chipotle. You do it enough times and getting back to cooking regularly becomes more and more unlikely.</p><p>How many barriers can you identify with my past system? First, cooking at home is a pain in the ass. Second, when buying food outside, there are far too many temptations. Third, even if I manage to convince myself to buy a salad, in the back of my mind I’m always thinking it’s a bad a deal because I’ll stay hungry after that salad.</p><p>Here is my new approach: my current employer provides catered lunches every day. I made a personal contract with myself to eat a giant bowl of salad from the salad bar first. <strong>Once</strong> I’m finished with the bowl, I can have absolutely <strong>anything</strong> I want. There are no limits. This contract addresses all barriers I’ve had for eating a healthy lunch. I don’t have to cook anything; I am not tempted by anything else since choices are limited; and I am not getting a bad deal because I can have anything I want afterwards. I just need to get through that bowl of salad first. As an added bonus, there’s very little I can eat once I’m done with the salad. I tend to be much more ambitious when hungry.</p><p>In general, try and identify all the little excuses you are giving yourself to stop doing what you really want to be doing. Once identified, try to design your life in a way that will break down those excuses in the most effortless way possible.</p><p>Other barriers usually include, distance, accessibility and ease of use. Watch out for these.</p><p><strong>Sets the correct incentive.</strong> You know how we said before you get [A] you must do [B]? Make sure that whatever [A] is, it is motivating enough to act as a trigger. If you remember reading my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">commitments for 2018,</a> you’ll recall that one of my commitments was to drink two cups of coffee a day. Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that as time goes on, I am creeping back to three cups. Each time I have it, I feel a little guilty but I reason that starting tomorrow I’ll be better. Instead of feeling guilt, I can turn this around and use it to my advantage.</p><p>I am a member of a gym located in the same building where I work. I am making the following personal contract: each time I feel like having a third cup of coffee, I must <strong>first</strong> hit the gym. The barriers to work out are exceedingly low and now I also have a great incentive to do the right thing (the fact that I made it public is a bonus).</p><p>You can generalize this approach as well. Essentially, you sacrifice one minor bad habit to enforce and carry out a major good habit by setting up the right incentives for yourself.</p><p><strong>Consistent with the individual.</strong> Sometimes, despite all the automation, best intentions, lowest barriers, and most enticing incentives, you still fail at your habit building; and that’s okay.</p><p>Coming up with these systems is an iterative process. You will always be tinkering with them. Always trying something new. Always looking for a better way of doing things. You’ll never get it just right the very first time.</p><p>The key is to keep trying new ways of doing things and experimenting with what works for you. For example, a cup of coffee might be enough to motivate me to go to the gym. You might want a new pair of sneakers instead. If that’s your barrier, don’t bother with my system. It won’t work for you.</p><p>When I come up with great systems that work for me, I am always very proud and happy to share — just wait until I write my post about budgeting.</p><p>Let me know if you have a system you are particularly proud of. I am always looking to tweak mine and share with others.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac415f0a8c79\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-state-of-the-art-system-to-goal-setting-ac415f0a8c79\">My state of the art system to goal setting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I can’t remember exactly what we were discussing but it must have been something interesting. It usually is. Suddenly, Zack asks me the following question:</p><blockquote>Where do you see yourself in five years?</blockquote><p>I haven’t been to an interview in a long time so I was caught off guard. I didn’t have a good enough, well rehearsed and politically correct answer to give. Then again, I wasn’t being actually interviewed for a job so I told him the honest truth. The truth is, I think that planning five years ahead is pointless if not counterproductive. I am sure that every lifestyle/productivity guru on the internet is having a meltdown right now. However, let me explain.</p><p>Presumably, setting a long term goal means the outcome is important to you. It is probably something that will make you happy and make you feel like a more accomplished person. Or will it? We’ve talked about this before. <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">What you think will make you happy doesn’t always make you happy</a>. You just may end up on the hamster wheel chasing the next goal.</p><p>More importantly, the goals that you set for yourself today might not even be applicable five years from now. Let me give you a concrete example. I’ll steal this one from Nina because it works out perfectly. She mentioned that one of her friends has five year goal to open up her own brewery. That sounds really fun right? However, how sure is this friend that brewing beer is what she really wants to do? Five years from now, her priorities could change completely. Has she spent enough time brewing beer for herself? Is she sure that running her own business is something that she wants?</p><p>Another mistake a lot of people make when setting their long term goals is making goals that are outside of their control. For example, you can set a goal for yourself to get married. Is that a good goal? I don’t think so. Yes, one way to hand over more control to yourself is to lower your expectations but I don’t think that’s what you had in mind when committing to this five years earlier.</p><p>So far I’ve just been warming up. Sure, all of the above is true, but the real reason five year goals are pointless is much simpler. The unpredictability of life makes it so. For example, five years ago I was happily living in Canada when all of a sudden I got an opportunity to work at a much fancier company for much fancier pay. All my five year plans had to be abandoned (if I had any). Two days ago my wife came back from Portugal and is convinced life is better over there. What’s my five year plan now?</p><p>I can hear all the detractors from my couch grumbling under their breath about how I just don’t understand the goal setting process. It doesn’t have to be this specific or set in stone. That’s true! However, how generic are you thinking? The reality is that once you make it somewhat generic, everyone wants roughly the same. Everyone wants to be healthier, stronger, better looking with a devoted spouse and a killer job. So what? How are you getting there? The devil is in the details.</p><p>I am not here just to be a <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/\">complainypants</a>. I also like to propose solutions. So here it goes: Do whatever you do to set your five year goal but set it for only <strong>one</strong> year ahead. Do this every year. At the end of the year, reevaluate and readjust. A year is generally enough to set substantial but achievable goals. At the same time, when things change — either your surrounding or your opinions — you have plenty of opportunity to reevaluate what you value and where you’re heading.</p><p>You can experiment with shorter periods of time as well, however, I suspect that if you do this too frequently, you won’t be giving yourself enough time to complete the goal. At the same time, you’ll be giving yourself a lot of opportunities to quit. One year seems like a good balance between some level of accountability and flexibility.</p><p>The key to make this recurring one year goal work is the <strong>reevaluation</strong> part of the process. Each year, you must check back on the goals you set for yourself in the beginning of year and evaluate your performance. Furthermore, reevaluate if you want to continue with this goal. Finally, and most importantly, step up the difficulty level of the goal.</p><p>I think of this as “managed personal growth”. <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2018 should be better in every way than <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2017.

    "content:encoded": "<h3>Happiness: ask, and you shall receive</h3><h4>Actionable items you can do today to engage your like system</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9Br032ZQMKtnnqb09MvhuQ.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This is part II of my discussion of “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Science-behind-Your-Smile/dp/0192805592\">Happiness: the science behind your smile</a>”. If you haven’t read part I, I encourage you to do so <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">here</a>. Everything will make a lot more sense if you do.</p><p>For those that have fully embraced the smartphone age and lack patience, here’s a quick summary:</p><p>Turns out what we <strong>want</strong> is frequently separate from what we <strong>like</strong>. The things we desire in life do not always bring us happiness. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective. Evolution does not care about your happiness. Its only objective is to propagate your genes. Therefore; your ancestors were rewarded when competing for status and acquiring resources. However, to be happy, you cannot simply chase your desires. Those desires must also bring you long term contentment. You can do this only if you engage both the “want system” and the “like system”.</p><p>Now that you’re up to speed, let’s dig in.</p><p>Shortly after publishing the first article about the two systems, my friend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zhiachong\">Zack</a> asked me a really interesting question.</p><blockquote>What’s an actionable item I can do today to determine what will appeal to my “want” and “like” system?</blockquote><p>I’ll be honest, I had to think long and hard about this one. My gut reaction was to write a piece bashing materialism and status seeking but I feel like it’s not very satisfying. It’s hard to convince anyone that driving a brand new Tesla SUV to work on daily basis will not bring them more happiness in life. Also, as my wife frequently reminds me, “not everyone wants to live like a monk”.</p><p>Consequently, I had to step back and reconsider. What else can you do to engage the “like system”?</p><p>We’ve already established that people are terrible at predicting how much happiness their desires will bring them. We tend to overestimate the pleasure we will gain from positive experiences. Similarly we tend to overestimate the pain we will experience from negative experiences. However, I am aware of at least one method that seems to be somewhat more reliable than our own intuition. <em>All you have to do is find someone who is at the same position you would like to be and ask them how they feel.</em></p><p>This might not be the bombshell you were expecting. However, the consequence of this idea is easy to overlook.</p><p>Consider for instance what you could do if you were buying a new house. You and your spouse might be looking for a 4 bedroom house at a near by suburb in a brand new development. It must have a 2 car garage and a ton of yard space to play ball with your future child. You will use the extra rooms as an office and an extra bedroom whenever your parents visit from out of town. Sure, it will increase your commute and the mortgage payments are a little high, but it’s worth it!</p><p>Sounds familiar? That’s because it is exactly what a typical couple does — at least around this part of town.</p><p>Before signing on the dotted line, and committing to 30 years of debt, you could ask a current home owner, roughly at the same stage of life, roughly with the same house, living in a similar neighborhood, what their day to day looks like. Do they have any regrets? Do they miss renting? How do they feel about Home Depot? What would they change if they could do it over again?</p><p>They may tell you that it’s incredible. It’s everything and more than they hoped for. They love entertaining friends on their brand new deck and all the neighbors are extremely friendly and pleasant. It’s the best decision they could have ever made.</p><p>Another possibility is that the commute is tough and stressful and the mortgage payments are stretching their finances further than they are comfortable. Maintaining it is also a daily grind.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, it is valuable information you didn’t have before. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy\">Dan Gilbert,</a> their response will also be a much better predictor of your future feelings than your own intuition.</p><p>Now let’s take it a step further. What if you didn’t just settle for asking people that are a single step ahead of you. What if you also asked people who are multiple steps ahead of you. For example, if your parents own their home, why not ask them? You could even use the same questions.</p><p>They may tell you it was a great investment and all their retirement savings are in the house. They were able to raise 2.6 children in that house and send them to the best public schools the department of education had to offer.</p><p>Similarly, they could tell you they never once in 20 years walked into that office/bedroom without a feather duster and windex in their hands. They regret not buying a smaller house and using the extra money to travel.</p><p>Again, valuable information but this time from a long term perspective.</p><p>Finally, you can take this advice to it’s logical conclusion. I hesitate to write this because it is a morbid way to think. However, the insight is absolutely invaluable. I am talking about an article appropriately titled <a href=\"https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/\">regrets of the dying</a>. It took me a long time to read this partially because I couldn’t get over how morbid it is. However, I highly encourage everyone to give it a chance. Once I got through it, I realized that the fear of regret is a very powerful reason to live right. It was also indirectly responsible for this article (and many others to come).</p><p>The regrets are of course very emotional and human. I think that all of us can predict at least half of them if we just sat down and tried to list them. Yet there is something powerfully contemplative even as I re-read them.</p><p>One regret I think would resonate with everyone is #4 — I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. This is something that could haunt you your entire life unless you devote a lot of concentrated effort to maintain these relationships. One major reason for this is our endless mobility. It is certainly a great opportunity to meet wonderful people. However, the relationships you form tend to be more shallow. Once “busyness” catches up with you, those are the first to go.</p><p>This is a focus area for myself although I will make it more official in my 2019 resolutions.</p><p>So what would these people tell you about your house choices if you somehow managed to ask them? I cannot speak for them authoritatively, but my guess is they’d tell you <em>to </em><strong><em>live</em></strong><em> your life and stop wasting your time on this shit because it really doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/dGCW_QOPKvc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kristian Gonzalez</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/prediction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1cd65d586463\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-appealing-to-the-like-system-1cd65d586463\">Happiness: appealing to the like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

If you are working the standard North American schedule, it would translate to 40 hours a week or 8 hours a day. Now imagine that through some innovation on your part, you are now able to produce the same number of pins at half the time. To satisfy the same demand you can now work only 4 hours a day and enjoy an additional 4 hours of leisure. Straightforward math so far.</p><p>Let’s take this a step further. This time, you’ve automated the process further and you can now produce the same number of pins at a quarter of the previous time. By the same math, now you can work an hour a day and enjoy 7 hours of additional leisure. This is essentially the reality for our productivity curve between 1950’s and today. We are far more productive today by every measure. <em>However, the number of hours we work hasn’t budged.</em></p><p>The above was a prediction by a famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, in 1930. The video is a lecture by a professor in Economics trying to answer why this prediction did not materialize. The lecture is very insightful and brings up many interesting statistics about work, prosperity and well being broken down by gender, age and race. However, his main reason as to why the number of hours we work hasn’t decreased despite much progress in productivity is our love for work and money.</p><p>Although he presents good evidence to support his case, I believe there are a couple of other reasons we are working the same 40 hour weeks as we did in the 50’s that he overlooked. I would also argue that these reasons are equally important if not more so.</p><p><strong>The system isn’t conductive to less hours. </strong>Let’s go back to our pin maker from before. If the pin maker decided to lay back and enjoy the additional 7 hours of leisure, what do you think would happen? All of her competitors would eventually figure out the same new, faster method of production and flood the market with pins since they can now produce more — each trying to wrestle away market share. In turn, that would push prices down and our (lazy) pin maker would quickly go out of business. This is the basis of capitalism.</p><p>We can thank our high standard of living to this phenomena. It brought us many innovations by aligning incentives and pushed billions of people out of poverty all around the world. It does this by rewarding work and innovation but penalizing complacency.</p><p>However, there are certainly few employers out there that have toyed with the idea of lowering work hours. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/?utm_term=.f0094467d9cd\">Amazon considered introducing a 30 hour work week for some of their employees</a>.</p><p>If we have employers that are open to this idea, why don’t the employees rise up and demand lower work hours? Do we love money this much? I think there’s another more subtle reason that is driving it beyond greed.</p><p><strong>Most people haven’t discovered their purpose. </strong>If you ever needed to describe your purpose in life, could you? Not the purpose <strong>of</strong> life, that’s also beyond the scope of this article. Your purpose in life is what you’d like to achieve or do. If you can’t, that’s okay. Few people can.</p><p>Once you free up those 7 hours of leisure time, you must have a way to fill them up with some leisure activities. If you don’t have a purpose, it’s hard to come up with things to do unless traveling the world for 40 years sounds like a good idea to you; and there’s certainly <a href=\"https://www.gocurrycracker.com/\">people who think so</a>.</p><p>I’ve encountered this a lot when I talk to people about financial independence (FI or effai 😃). The question of what I would do with all that free time immediately comes up. This question sometimes stems from curiosity and other times to ridicule the idea (read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">article</a> for my thoughts on this behaviour). I’ve spoken to countless people about FI but only a handful ever considered what they would do if they had more time.</p><p>That’s why a job is usually the de facto source of purpose and the main occupier of time for most people. Once it’s taken away, people may feel lost. That’s also why <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-retirement-may-be-the-kiss-of-death-study-finds_us_57221aa3e4b01a5ebde49eff\">early retirees seem to die earlier</a>.</p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t even be considering FI if I believed dying early was an inevitable fact and no amount of salad eating could save me. Nor would I ever recommend it to anyone else. I believe that anyone who is working towards FI the traditional way — that is, by saving hard — must at some point consider their purpose. Otherwise they could not maintain the motivation to save so much for 15 plus years. That’s a tiny minority of people though.</p><p>Hence the result. Still working 100% of the time while creating 800% the product instead of working 1/8th of the time while producing 100% of the product.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eb73548c2121\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-real-reason-economic-progress-hasnt-lowered-work-hours-more-eb73548c2121\">The real reason economic progress hasn’t lowered work hours more</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

For me, it all started a three weeks back. Up until that point, I thought very little about my toilet (as I should). My most memorable recollection was installing a soft close cover on it so it wouldn’t bang when I put the seat down. Otherwise, it was just like every other toilet — white, round and a great place to browse your phone.</p><p>So what lessons could I possibly learn from this familiar household item? Allow me to offer the following <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=allegory\">allegory</a>.</p><p>As many of you know, I dabble in a some <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">house hacking</a>. I rent out my basement on Airbnb to random people on the internet. On Sunday I got the following lovely message from my guests: “the toilet isn’t flushing”. Thankfully, there was nothing in there I couldn’t handle. I headed downstairs, pulled out the plunger and started plunging vigorously. I plunged for about an hour. I tried all sorts of techniques. I put hot water in there. I put soap in there. I ended up with a bowl full of hot soapy bubbles. Eventually, I had to admit that I needed professional help.</p><p>I called the first plumber I could find on Google. He showed up within a few hours looking ready to unclog some pipes. He started with the auger (long wire you stuff in the toilet). He stuck it in there, rotated it a bunch of times but no luck. He removed the toilet off the floor and tried again. Still no luck. All I could think was “What the hell did those hippies flush down my toilet?”.</p><p>He mentioned we’re going to need some more heavy duty equipment. Keep in mind that I have Airbnb guests in my house with a dysfunctional toilet. They are not going to be very happy. On top of it, I live in an old house. Our pipes are… questionable. How much is this going to cost me? I am now quite nervous.</p><p>We brought down a 400 pound roll of metallic tubing. He stuck it in the pipe and started unwinding it in. He kept going all the way to the end. When he pulled it out, we found an extension cord wrapped around the metallic tubing.</p><p>As we both stood there scratching our heads wondering how this is even possible, my wife was still thinking straight. She Googled it quickly and identified it as a part of our sewage pump. Turns out if your toilet is below the sewage line, you need a pump to get the waste out (makes sense once you think about it). The plumber must have ripped off the cord while digging for clogs.</p><p>He put the toilet back in place; Charged me $350; told me I need to get a qualified professional and bounced.</p><p>I started to frantically call anyone who could possibly help. I needed this done ASAP. We have paying customers in the house who need to … use the facilities. The best I could do is get a guy to show up in two days. The estimate for a replacement was $1600.</p><p>I don’t know if you’ve ever dealt with plumbers, electricians or any general maintenance workers but they aren’t exactly known for being reliable.</p><p>That night, I couldn’t sleep. I was worried the plumber wouldn’t show; replacing the pump wouldn’t fix the issue; or that it would escalate to more problems. I woke up the next day with a big headache — exhausted and stressed.</p><p>On a whim, I decided to call the initial company and complain about the plumber; maybe they’ll offer me a discount. I dialed their number, and politely explained what happened. Instead of a discount, they offered to fix the pump for free. Another plumber showed up later in the day, replaced the pump within an hour and charged me nothing for labour and material.</p><p>Once he finished, I rushed downstairs and started flushing that toilet over and over. Flushing never felt so good. The next night, I slept like a baby. I don’t remember the last time I slept that well. I woke up refreshed, feeling great, ready to take on the world.</p><p>What really inspired this story is how vividly I remember the difference in those two days. When the toilet was broken and everything seemed like an endless series of disasters, life was hard — I was stressed and miserable. Dealing with this shit (pun intended) was not fun. Once the toilet service was restored, my life was turned upside down. I felt free. I felt good. I felt like anything was possible. In short life was glorious again. What a difference 24 hours can do for your well being.</p><p>More importantly, I recognized how much we take for granted. As long as this toilet was working, I never paid attention to it. I pulled the lever down. The water flushed away all my troubles. Life went on. However, once this process failed, my outlook changed. All of a sudden my house wasn’t this impenetrable castle but a money pit. And running that Airbnb wasn’t a license to print money but just a bunch of hassles.</p><p>Granted, I did not feel like that for long. Once everything was fixed and settled, I was more than happy to take my guests’ money for the right to stay in my basement (I did offer a free night for the trouble). Also, I ended up getting a brand new sewage pump installed for a bargain price.</p><p>Upon reflection, I had to ask myself the following question:</p><blockquote>What can I do to experience life like I did on Monday, everyday?</blockquote><p>In other words, how can I wake up feeling refreshed and energized, all worries alleviated and the anxiety extinguished. Turns out my experience that week is a common phenomena encountered regularly. In fact, we even have an aphorism to explain what happened:</p><blockquote>“You don’t know what you have until it’s gone”</blockquote><p>Duh. Everyone knows that. But what can we do about it?</p><p>One thing I could do is sabotage my plumbing on regular basis and deal with the plumber while my Airbnb guests are watching. I don’t think it’s a scalable solution though so I wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p>Another option is to practice what is usually referred to as “gratitude journaling”. <a href=\"http://thehowofhappiness.com/\">Sonja Lyubomirsky</a> talks extensively about this technique in her book, “The how of happiness”.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Happiness-Approach-Getting-Life/dp/0143114956/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535605491&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+how+of+happiness\">The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want</a></p><p>It entails taking two minutes out of your day (or week) to write down 3 things you’re thankful for. It can be anything. It can be as mundane as catching the bus on time or as significant as getting promoted at work or as pivotal as getting engaged. The key to this exercise is to regularly consider all the things you’re thankful for and consciously become a more grateful person.</p><p>I’ve known about this method for years. Yet somehow, this spiritual, new age approach never resonated with me. I would imagine people sitting in a circle, humming, holding their energy crystals with one hand and writing in their journals made of recycled fabrics with the other.</p><p>If the above doesn’t appeal to you, feel free to drop all the spiritual moonshine and concentrate on the psychological benefits. The root act is simple. Think about what you’re thankful for; be grateful, write it down. Repeat tomorrow.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ba883a11224c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-flushing-the-toilet-made-me-appreciate-the-little-things-in-life-ba883a11224c\">How flushing the toilet made me appreciate the little things in life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Hashtags were flying around with snazzy slogans celebrating unity and harmony, identity and integrity and all sorts of other hippy war cries. We got to talk about the company’s future direction and gossip about internal politics.</p><p>Once each day came to a close, we headed to the restaurants to eat the finest Pad Thai San Francisco had to offer. We all had a daily allowance and I’ll be damned if I didn’t use it! On the last day, we had a giant party with unlimited tequila shots and a fish taco stand.</p><p>That night, I downed my fifth fluid ounce of tequila and headed straight for my friend Colin who was in the midst of a deep conversation with Nina and Zack. I don’t know what they were talking about, but I overheard the following phrase</p><blockquote>Your actions reflect your values</blockquote><p>Cool, I thought. Heard that one before. Nothing new. I’ll take that beer now.</p><p>Once the party was over, I stumbled my way to the hotel and passed out.</p><p>The next day I woke up at 10am with a pounding headache. I was incapacitated to my room for the next 9 hours while my liver was hard at work. The only positive outcome of that experience was the opportunity to reflect on my actions.</p><p>I am the guy who preaches the gospel of low sugar diets to anyone who will dare to listen. I spend copious amounts of time roaming the internet for information about insulin, cholesterol, and inflammation.

I worked hard on my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a> to use my time wisely. I found plenty of time to browse nonsense on the internet throughout that week. I did not however find time to call my mother.</p><p>If the statement above is true — if actions dictate your values — my values are… off. They are certainly not what I expected them to be.</p><p>I am glad Colin brought up that phrase. Thanks to him, I had a mini-epiphany while nursing my hangover.</p><p>Up to last week, my <strong>values</strong> dictated my <strong>actions </strong>— up to a point. Occasionally, I would give myself a break from being good … and be bad. I would drink a little too much. I would browse YouTube a little too long. I would get into an argument on Twitter a little too fast.</p><p>The new me prefaces these “undesirable” behaviours with the following question:</p><blockquote>Does this action reflect my values?</blockquote><p>Does drinking a pint of beer reflect my values? Nope. Maybe I’ll think again before ordering a second round. Better yet, I can go for a tall glass of kombucha instead.</p><p>This approach can work for anyone.

Everything is attentively dusted and meticulously arranged. The sink is empty of all dishes. The oven is pre-heating that delicious pot roast. And of course, there’s figs and pistachios neatly laid out in beautiful bowls on the dining table to tie us over until dinner is served.</p><p>In turn, when we invite those friends over, there’s a certain level of underlying obligation to live up to those expectations. If our friends had figs and pistachios, we must have cranberries and walnuts ready for them. If they had a perfectly arranged kitchen cabinet, we must do the same. We certainly cannot afford to wear our comfortable home clothes — we must dress up.</p><p>Of course, this friendly race to outdo each other does not come for free. It actually takes a heavy toll on us. We cannot simply allow to have people over. We must clear up our entire day to do all the cleaning and cooking and shopping and planning. It’s exhausting. Hosting people turned from being a pleasurable bonding activity to a major inconvenience. We end up thinking twice before inviting anyone.</p><p>Here’s what I propose (technically it’s my wife’s idea. Giving credit where it’s due): I propose that we stop putting up these facades to hide behind. We all know that everyone’s houses are a mess when no one is looking. We all know that your fridge isn’t always stocked full of goodies just ready to eat. And you know what? That’s okay.</p><p>This idea makes most millennial aged individuals very nervous for two reasons.</p><ol><li>It will expose things that no one knows about them expect their spouse. However, we don’t have to make it extreme. Take for example the 30 minute warning approach: If you’ll be in the neighborhood, call your potential host 30 minutes ahead of your arrival. That gives them just enough time to pick up their socks off the floor and close the bedroom door.</li><li>As a guest, you also tend to feel awkward about dropping in suddenly. What if they are busy? What if they don’t want to see me? What if ….? I think this reluctance stems from years of being accustomed to all these obligations when you are hosting. In turn, when other people are hosting, you don’t want to impose. These feelings are perfectly reasonable but we must break out of the cycle of doubt.</li></ol><p>Implementing this approach in our day to day lives is easy. All we have to do is tell each other that it’s okay. <strong>It’s okay to just drop by</strong>.</p><p>Naturally, when adopting this, there are three caveats I must mention:</p><ul><li>Make sure your host is home (duh).</li><li>Make sure your host is free. If they are busy, don’t assume it’s an attack on your character. They just have things to do.</li><li>Know your limits. The idea is not to spend your entire Saturday at someone’s house.</li></ul><p>The idea is inspired by observing my own parents and their huge circle of friends. They constantly seem to have people over but they are never particularly stressed out about it. It’s not uncommon to have 3 different sets of people show up throughout the day. They are usually served a cup of tea and whatever they can find available in the fridge.</p><p>This is sort of how I imagine people living in those small European towns in Greece where everyone is old and happy and all they do is socialize. I want to be old and happy too!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=651c5adacc26\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/proposal-dropping-in-on-people-is-not-the-worst-thing-ever-651c5adacc26\">Proposal: dropping in on people is not the worst thing ever</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, my perfectionist wife has been setting up the room for a month prior to that. The possibility of someone giving us a three star rating is just too much to bear. Thankfully, we’ve been getting only five star ratings so far.</p><p>To ensure the five star rating keeps coming, we’ve had to go through each corner of the basement and clear it out, rearrange the furniture and fix any outstanding nagging maintenance issues. As a result, we’ve taken several trunk-loads of stuff straight to Goodwill — mostly random junk that was packed away in the basement, forgotten about and collecting dust.</p><p>The basement was also the place where our TV lived. We do not have another one upstairs. It is also the place where I kept my clothes. My wife graciously allowed me to keep my stuff in the basement while she took over the bedroom closet. It incorporated my own private bathroom as well. We’ve never had to worry where to keep my shaving paraphernalia versus her hair products.</p><p>Since we’ve started renting the basement, things had to change. We’ve shifted from having 1600 square feet to 900. My clothes moved upstairs. We’ve had to isolate a small corner in the closet for me. The bathrooms were unified (it is going through a clean up process as I am writing this). There’s also no more television.</p><blockquote>Essentially, we’ve forced ourselves into adopting a certain level of minimalism.</blockquote><p>Minimalism was never the intention when considering Airbnb. Instead, I was always thinking about our TTF (time to financial independence). That’s because Airbnb is the classic example of passivish income (I made that up). Your existing asset (the house) is doing most of the heavy lifting. You just need to remember to pay the bills. The more you automate, the more passive it becomes.</p><p>One glance around here and you’ll know right away that I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">minimalism</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/tagged/intentional-living\">intentional living</a>. That’s why it came to me as a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise when I realized I am forced to downsize substantially.</p><p>Before you jump to conclusions, this is not some personality disorder or twisted reasoning. I am not actively trying to induce self-harm. This is a very conscious decision. Ponder this idea of <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/\">happiness through subtraction</a> for example to see where I’m coming from. If you’re still not convinced, that’s fine. I’ll have a lot more to say about minimalism in the future.</p><p>In the mean time, for anyone thinking about their TTF, you should know there are some unintended consequences to Airbnb that go well beyond the money; intentional minimalism happens to be one of them.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=53c7a6122982\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">Surprising unintended consequences of Airbnb hosting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Don’t get me wrong, I am not depressed (all my friends can testify!). In fact, I am happy, just not as much as I think I should be. Nothing is seriously wrong or need to be fixed about my life. I have a great paying job, amazing friends and brilliant co-workers, and I feel strong and healthy. Yet I still want to be happier.</p><p>For the past week, I pursued a quest to measure my own happiness. This is surprisingly difficult. The feeling of happiness is not a boolean but a scale. I can roughly estimate an average of 7/10 daily happiness level. I wonder where the missing 3 went.</p><p>Where does 7 came from, you may ask. I imagine my happiness point is derived from some sort of goal or task completion. It could be a small task like doing groceries or a bigger goal like getting a promotion. To explain my thought process better, I made a formula out of it.</p><p>Assume that one atomic unit of happiness is called <em>joy</em>. Each task or goal completion can spark X amount of <em>joy </em>based on level of challenge. My todo list on the weekend looks like this.</p><ul><li>Water a plant <em>= 5 joy after completion</em></li><li>Clean up my bathroom <em>= 30 joy after completion</em></li><li>File taxes <em>= 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium <em>= 100 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>Let’s say my threshold of happiness per day is at 100. If I complete everything in the list (even filing taxes!), I should have a very happy Saturday. Well, the truth is.. not really.</p><blockquote>The pure happiness I feel from achieving goals is only temporary. A better goal is contentment or fulfillment.</blockquote><p>The formula above fails to capture the sense of fulfillment, which comes from having a purpose and being present in the moment. That is why focusing on goal completion alone is for amateurs. We need to feel consistent fulfillment throughout the journey to the goal.</p><p>How should I represent fulfillment in this formula? Since fulfillment is all about enjoying the moment, it should perhaps be represented as <em>joy gain per minute (as long as we feel happy in those minutes)</em>. As time progresses, total fulfillment is equal to the <em>joy/min multiplied by the time spend. </em>Let’s try the formula again.</p><ul><li>Watch Netflix (1 hour)<em> = 1 joy/min + 0 joy after completion</em></li><li>File tax (3 hours) <em>= 0 joy/min + 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium (~5 hour) <em>= 0.2 joy/min + 40 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>You may argue that the fulfillment gain may not always progress linearly with time. For example, if my Medium post took more than 5 hours to write, I would gain no more fulfillment after the 5 hours past. I agree! Well, for the sake of simplicity, let’s ignore that for now and assume only the upper bound of fulfillment that you can reach. Now let’s categorize all tasks into one of the three buckets.</p><ul><li><strong>Highly fulfilling activity. </strong>The activities such as watching Netflix, or drinking with friends are highly fulfilling but provides zero achievement afterwards.</li><li><strong>Pure achievement.</strong> These activities could be painful to go through but yield accomplishment afterward such as cooking, searching for a bike to buy, or filing tax. I wish I could just finish them quickly.</li><li><strong>Highly fulfilling with sense of achievement. </strong>I have only handful of these in my life such as reading a book, learning to snowboard, or writing this blog post.</li></ul><p>This lens is helpful to detach myself from the end-goal ultra focus, and constantly reminding myself to <em>live</em> in the moment. I start thinking of my day as the combination of <em>30% fulfillment and 70% achievement and started optimizing for the third bucket.</em> Many mundane tasks like folding clothes or biking can also be extremely fulfilling and could be part of the bigger goal achievement (if you think about it hard enough).</p><blockquote>Slowly, I feel that completing the goal has become less important, but having the right balance is more crucial to my overall happiness.</blockquote><p>Thank you for reading it this far.

Everyone is always trying to change something about themselves. The typical things includes the food they eat, the amount of exercise they get, how they spend their time and how they prioritize their lives. Turns out, change is harder than reading a blog online.</p><p>People are also creatures of habit. We all have our morning routines, our night routines, our commute to work routine and the web sites we visit on our lunch break routine. In fact, when we are put in new environments where executing our routines is hard, we generally tend to skip workouts and eat fried chicken for dinner.</p><p>I am going to share with you an approach that I use to form better habits. It is not fool proof. It does require some upfront investment. However, I believe it could work for almost any habit you are trying to form as long as you apply enough creativity. The system is very simple to apply. All you have to do is <em>create a system. </em>Yes, you read that right, the system is to create systems. Let me explain.</p><p>When I say “system”, I’m talking about a set of rules, or guidelines you use to guide your choices. The side effect of those rules should be that you execute your desired habit. Think of these rules as formalizing a contract with yourself. The contract has at least one rule: <em>I can have as much [A] as I want. However, before I get [A], I must do [B]</em>. This is what I call a personal contract.</p><p>The inspiration came from <a href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\">Dr. BJ Fogg</a>, a researcher in behaviour design who had a great TED talk a few years back about this exact topic.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%3Fstart%3D689%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D689&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAdKUJxjn-R8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href\">https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href</a></iframe><blockquote>If you use an existing behaviour in your life, and you put the new, tiny behaviour <em>after </em>it, you can use the existing behaviour to be the trigger.</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, over time, I noticed that simply defining the contract wasn’t always enough. Frequently, I couldn’t uphold the contract for long or I would completely forget about it. In fact, it was really a hit or miss — occasionally it would work really well but periodically it would completely fall apart.</p><p>More recently, I took a look at some personal contracts I was able to maintain for a long stretch and tried to boil it down to what made them different. I have identified four hallmarks of a good personal contract.</p><p><strong>Automatic.</strong> If you can set this up for your desired habit, your job is practically done. For example, before I spend any money, I max out my 401k. I can automate this through my paycheque contributions. Done!</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to automate certain areas of your life. Exercising effectively requires you to be doing exercise. Calling your mom once a week requires you to talk (at least for now).</p><p>However, there’s a clear subset of bad habits that can be automated away. Anything digital will naturally fall here. Do you have bad browsing behaviour? Are you spending too much time on your Twitter/Facebook/YouTube ? There’s an app for that. Are you having trouble saving or budgeting? There’s a bank for that.</p><p>The advantage of automating bad habits away is you only have that upfront cost once but you reap the dividends indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Breaks down barriers. </strong>One habit that I recently found to be absolutely effortless is the habit of eating a healthy lunch. In the past, I’ve tried cooking at home or buying out healthy lunches but inevitably you skip cooking for a few nights and end up ordering a large barbacoa burrito at Chipotle. You do it enough times and getting back to cooking regularly becomes more and more unlikely.</p><p>How many barriers can you identify with my past system? First, cooking at home is a pain in the ass. Second, when buying food outside, there are far too many temptations. Third, even if I manage to convince myself to buy a salad, in the back of my mind I’m always thinking it’s a bad a deal because I’ll stay hungry after that salad.</p><p>Here is my new approach: my current employer provides catered lunches every day. I made a personal contract with myself to eat a giant bowl of salad from the salad bar first. <strong>Once</strong> I’m finished with the bowl, I can have absolutely <strong>anything</strong> I want. There are no limits. This contract addresses all barriers I’ve had for eating a healthy lunch. I don’t have to cook anything; I am not tempted by anything else since choices are limited; and I am not getting a bad deal because I can have anything I want afterwards. I just need to get through that bowl of salad first. As an added bonus, there’s very little I can eat once I’m done with the salad. I tend to be much more ambitious when hungry.</p><p>In general, try and identify all the little excuses you are giving yourself to stop doing what you really want to be doing. Once identified, try to design your life in a way that will break down those excuses in the most effortless way possible.</p><p>Other barriers usually include, distance, accessibility and ease of use. Watch out for these.</p><p><strong>Sets the correct incentive.</strong> You know how we said before you get [A] you must do [B]? Make sure that whatever [A] is, it is motivating enough to act as a trigger. If you remember reading my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">commitments for 2018,</a> you’ll recall that one of my commitments was to drink two cups of coffee a day. Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that as time goes on, I am creeping back to three cups. Each time I have it, I feel a little guilty but I reason that starting tomorrow I’ll be better. Instead of feeling guilt, I can turn this around and use it to my advantage.</p><p>I am a member of a gym located in the same building where I work. I am making the following personal contract: each time I feel like having a third cup of coffee, I must <strong>first</strong> hit the gym. The barriers to work out are exceedingly low and now I also have a great incentive to do the right thing (the fact that I made it public is a bonus).</p><p>You can generalize this approach as well. Essentially, you sacrifice one minor bad habit to enforce and carry out a major good habit by setting up the right incentives for yourself.</p><p><strong>Consistent with the individual.</strong> Sometimes, despite all the automation, best intentions, lowest barriers, and most enticing incentives, you still fail at your habit building; and that’s okay.</p><p>Coming up with these systems is an iterative process. You will always be tinkering with them. Always trying something new. Always looking for a better way of doing things. You’ll never get it just right the very first time.</p><p>The key is to keep trying new ways of doing things and experimenting with what works for you. For example, a cup of coffee might be enough to motivate me to go to the gym. You might want a new pair of sneakers instead. If that’s your barrier, don’t bother with my system. It won’t work for you.</p><p>When I come up with great systems that work for me, I am always very proud and happy to share — just wait until I write my post about budgeting.</p><p>Let me know if you have a system you are particularly proud of. I am always looking to tweak mine and share with others.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac415f0a8c79\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-state-of-the-art-system-to-goal-setting-ac415f0a8c79\">My state of the art system to goal setting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I can’t remember exactly what we were discussing but it must have been something interesting. It usually is. Suddenly, Zack asks me the following question:</p><blockquote>Where do you see yourself in five years?</blockquote><p>I haven’t been to an interview in a long time so I was caught off guard. I didn’t have a good enough, well rehearsed and politically correct answer to give. Then again, I wasn’t being actually interviewed for a job so I told him the honest truth. The truth is, I think that planning five years ahead is pointless if not counterproductive. I am sure that every lifestyle/productivity guru on the internet is having a meltdown right now. However, let me explain.</p><p>Presumably, setting a long term goal means the outcome is important to you. It is probably something that will make you happy and make you feel like a more accomplished person. Or will it? We’ve talked about this before. <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">What you think will make you happy doesn’t always make you happy</a>. You just may end up on the hamster wheel chasing the next goal.</p><p>More importantly, the goals that you set for yourself today might not even be applicable five years from now. Let me give you a concrete example. I’ll steal this one from Nina because it works out perfectly. She mentioned that one of her friends has five year goal to open up her own brewery. That sounds really fun right? However, how sure is this friend that brewing beer is what she really wants to do? Five years from now, her priorities could change completely. Has she spent enough time brewing beer for herself? Is she sure that running her own business is something that she wants?</p><p>Another mistake a lot of people make when setting their long term goals is making goals that are outside of their control. For example, you can set a goal for yourself to get married. Is that a good goal? I don’t think so. Yes, one way to hand over more control to yourself is to lower your expectations but I don’t think that’s what you had in mind when committing to this five years earlier.</p><p>So far I’ve just been warming up. Sure, all of the above is true, but the real reason five year goals are pointless is much simpler. The unpredictability of life makes it so. For example, five years ago I was happily living in Canada when all of a sudden I got an opportunity to work at a much fancier company for much fancier pay. All my five year plans had to be abandoned (if I had any). Two days ago my wife came back from Portugal and is convinced life is better over there. What’s my five year plan now?</p><p>I can hear all the detractors from my couch grumbling under their breath about how I just don’t understand the goal setting process. It doesn’t have to be this specific or set in stone. That’s true! However, how generic are you thinking? The reality is that once you make it somewhat generic, everyone wants roughly the same. Everyone wants to be healthier, stronger, better looking with a devoted spouse and a killer job. So what? How are you getting there? The devil is in the details.</p><p>I am not here just to be a <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/\">complainypants</a>. I also like to propose solutions. So here it goes: Do whatever you do to set your five year goal but set it for only <strong>one</strong> year ahead. Do this every year. At the end of the year, reevaluate and readjust. A year is generally enough to set substantial but achievable goals. At the same time, when things change — either your surrounding or your opinions — you have plenty of opportunity to reevaluate what you value and where you’re heading.</p><p>You can experiment with shorter periods of time as well, however, I suspect that if you do this too frequently, you won’t be giving yourself enough time to complete the goal. At the same time, you’ll be giving yourself a lot of opportunities to quit. One year seems like a good balance between some level of accountability and flexibility.</p><p>The key to make this recurring one year goal work is the <strong>reevaluation</strong> part of the process. Each year, you must check back on the goals you set for yourself in the beginning of year and evaluate your performance. Furthermore, reevaluate if you want to continue with this goal. Finally, and most importantly, step up the difficulty level of the goal.</p><p>I think of this as “managed personal growth”. <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2018 should be better in every way than <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2017.

If you haven’t read part I, I encourage you to do so <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">here</a>. Everything will make a lot more sense if you do.</p><p>For those that have fully embraced the smartphone age and lack patience, here’s a quick summary:</p><p>Turns out what we <strong>want</strong> is frequently separate from what we <strong>like</strong>. The things we desire in life do not always bring us happiness. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective. Evolution does not care about your happiness. Its only objective is to propagate your genes. Therefore; your ancestors were rewarded when competing for status and acquiring resources. However, to be happy, you cannot simply chase your desires. Those desires must also bring you long term contentment. You can do this only if you engage both the “want system” and the “like system”.</p><p>Now that you’re up to speed, let’s dig in.</p><p>Shortly after publishing the first article about the two systems, my friend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zhiachong\">Zack</a> asked me a really interesting question.</p><blockquote>What’s an actionable item I can do today to determine what will appeal to my “want” and “like” system?</blockquote><p>I’ll be honest, I had to think long and hard about this one. My gut reaction was to write a piece bashing materialism and status seeking but I feel like it’s not very satisfying. It’s hard to convince anyone that driving a brand new Tesla SUV to work on daily basis will not bring them more happiness in life. Also, as my wife frequently reminds me, “not everyone wants to live like a monk”.</p><p>Consequently, I had to step back and reconsider. What else can you do to engage the “like system”?</p><p>We’ve already established that people are terrible at predicting how much happiness their desires will bring them. We tend to overestimate the pleasure we will gain from positive experiences. Similarly we tend to overestimate the pain we will experience from negative experiences. However, I am aware of at least one method that seems to be somewhat more reliable than our own intuition. <em>All you have to do is find someone who is at the same position you would like to be and ask them how they feel.</em></p><p>This might not be the bombshell you were expecting. However, the consequence of this idea is easy to overlook.</p><p>Consider for instance what you could do if you were buying a new house. You and your spouse might be looking for a 4 bedroom house at a near by suburb in a brand new development. It must have a 2 car garage and a ton of yard space to play ball with your future child. You will use the extra rooms as an office and an extra bedroom whenever your parents visit from out of town. Sure, it will increase your commute and the mortgage payments are a little high, but it’s worth it!</p><p>Sounds familiar? That’s because it is exactly what a typical couple does — at least around this part of town.</p><p>Before signing on the dotted line, and committing to 30 years of debt, you could ask a current home owner, roughly at the same stage of life, roughly with the same house, living in a similar neighborhood, what their day to day looks like. Do they have any regrets? Do they miss renting? How do they feel about Home Depot? What would they change if they could do it over again?</p><p>They may tell you that it’s incredible. It’s everything and more than they hoped for. They love entertaining friends on their brand new deck and all the neighbors are extremely friendly and pleasant. It’s the best decision they could have ever made.</p><p>Another possibility is that the commute is tough and stressful and the mortgage payments are stretching their finances further than they are comfortable. Maintaining it is also a daily grind.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, it is valuable information you didn’t have before. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy\">Dan Gilbert,</a> their response will also be a much better predictor of your future feelings than your own intuition.</p><p>Now let’s take it a step further. What if you didn’t just settle for asking people that are a single step ahead of you. What if you also asked people who are multiple steps ahead of you. For example, if your parents own their home, why not ask them? You could even use the same questions.</p><p>They may tell you it was a great investment and all their retirement savings are in the house. They were able to raise 2.6 children in that house and send them to the best public schools the department of education had to offer.</p><p>Similarly, they could tell you they never once in 20 years walked into that office/bedroom without a feather duster and windex in their hands. They regret not buying a smaller house and using the extra money to travel.</p><p>Again, valuable information but this time from a long term perspective.</p><p>Finally, you can take this advice to it’s logical conclusion. I hesitate to write this because it is a morbid way to think. However, the insight is absolutely invaluable. I am talking about an article appropriately titled <a href=\"https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/\">regrets of the dying</a>. It took me a long time to read this partially because I couldn’t get over how morbid it is. However, I highly encourage everyone to give it a chance. Once I got through it, I realized that the fear of regret is a very powerful reason to live right. It was also indirectly responsible for this article (and many others to come).</p><p>The regrets are of course very emotional and human. I think that all of us can predict at least half of them if we just sat down and tried to list them. Yet there is something powerfully contemplative even as I re-read them.</p><p>One regret I think would resonate with everyone is #4 — I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. This is something that could haunt you your entire life unless you devote a lot of concentrated effort to maintain these relationships. One major reason for this is our endless mobility. It is certainly a great opportunity to meet wonderful people. However, the relationships you form tend to be more shallow. Once “busyness” catches up with you, those are the first to go.</p><p>This is a focus area for myself although I will make it more official in my 2019 resolutions.</p><p>So what would these people tell you about your house choices if you somehow managed to ask them? I cannot speak for them authoritatively, but my guess is they’d tell you <em>to </em><strong><em>live</em></strong><em> your life and stop wasting your time on this shit because it really doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/dGCW_QOPKvc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kristian Gonzalez</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/prediction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1cd65d586463\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-appealing-to-the-like-system-1cd65d586463\">Happiness: appealing to the like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

If you are working the standard North American schedule, it would translate to 40 hours a week or 8 hours a day. Now imagine that through some innovation on your part, you are now able to produce the same number of pins at half the time. To satisfy the same demand you can now work only 4 hours a day and enjoy an additional 4 hours of leisure. Straightforward math so far.</p><p>Let’s take this a step further. This time, you’ve automated the process further and you can now produce the same number of pins at a quarter of the previous time. By the same math, now you can work an hour a day and enjoy 7 hours of additional leisure. This is essentially the reality for our productivity curve between 1950’s and today. We are far more productive today by every measure. <em>However, the number of hours we work hasn’t budged.</em></p><p>The above was a prediction by a famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, in 1930. The video is a lecture by a professor in Economics trying to answer why this prediction did not materialize. The lecture is very insightful and brings up many interesting statistics about work, prosperity and well being broken down by gender, age and race. However, his main reason as to why the number of hours we work hasn’t decreased despite much progress in productivity is our love for work and money.</p><p>Although he presents good evidence to support his case, I believe there are a couple of other reasons we are working the same 40 hour weeks as we did in the 50’s that he overlooked. I would also argue that these reasons are equally important if not more so.</p><p><strong>The system isn’t conductive to less hours. </strong>Let’s go back to our pin maker from before. If the pin maker decided to lay back and enjoy the additional 7 hours of leisure, what do you think would happen? All of her competitors would eventually figure out the same new, faster method of production and flood the market with pins since they can now produce more — each trying to wrestle away market share. In turn, that would push prices down and our (lazy) pin maker would quickly go out of business. This is the basis of capitalism.</p><p>We can thank our high standard of living to this phenomena. It brought us many innovations by aligning incentives and pushed billions of people out of poverty all around the world. It does this by rewarding work and innovation but penalizing complacency.</p><p>However, there are certainly few employers out there that have toyed with the idea of lowering work hours. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/?utm_term=.f0094467d9cd\">Amazon considered introducing a 30 hour work week for some of their employees</a>.</p><p>If we have employers that are open to this idea, why don’t the employees rise up and demand lower work hours? Do we love money this much? I think there’s another more subtle reason that is driving it beyond greed.</p><p><strong>Most people haven’t discovered their purpose. </strong>If you ever needed to describe your purpose in life, could you? Not the purpose <strong>of</strong> life, that’s also beyond the scope of this article. Your purpose in life is what you’d like to achieve or do. If you can’t, that’s okay. Few people can.</p><p>Once you free up those 7 hours of leisure time, you must have a way to fill them up with some leisure activities. If you don’t have a purpose, it’s hard to come up with things to do unless traveling the world for 40 years sounds like a good idea to you; and there’s certainly <a href=\"https://www.gocurrycracker.com/\">people who think so</a>.</p><p>I’ve encountered this a lot when I talk to people about financial independence (FI or effai 😃). The question of what I would do with all that free time immediately comes up. This question sometimes stems from curiosity and other times to ridicule the idea (read this <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">article</a> for my thoughts on this behaviour). I’ve spoken to countless people about FI but only a handful ever considered what they would do if they had more time.</p><p>That’s why a job is usually the de facto source of purpose and the main occupier of time for most people. Once it’s taken away, people may feel lost. That’s also why <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-retirement-may-be-the-kiss-of-death-study-finds_us_57221aa3e4b01a5ebde49eff\">early retirees seem to die earlier</a>.</p><p>Of course, I wouldn’t even be considering FI if I believed dying early was an inevitable fact and no amount of salad eating could save me. Nor would I ever recommend it to anyone else. I believe that anyone who is working towards FI the traditional way — that is, by saving hard — must at some point consider their purpose. Otherwise they could not maintain the motivation to save so much for 15 plus years. That’s a tiny minority of people though.</p><p>Hence the result. Still working 100% of the time while creating 800% the product instead of working 1/8th of the time while producing 100% of the product.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eb73548c2121\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-real-reason-economic-progress-hasnt-lowered-work-hours-more-eb73548c2121\">The real reason economic progress hasn’t lowered work hours more</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

The overall theme discusses how far we’ve disconnected from our food supply and how the current food system has become the new normal.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Folks-This-Aint-Normal-Healthier/dp/0892968206/ref=sr_1_1/138-3405931-4273649?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516312773&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=folks+this+ain%27t+normal\">Folks, This Ain&#39;t Normal: A Farmer&#39;s Advice for Happier Hens, Healthier People, and a Better World</a></p><p>Speaking of new norms, Joel mentions something called a “larder” which was quite common before refrigeration but fell out of favour in more modern times. To be honest, I’ve never heard of that term and had to turn to Google to help me decipher it. Clearly, the question of how people kept food before modern refrigerators didn’t come up in my mind very frequently.</p><p>If you are comfortable not knowing what a larder is because it’s an obsolete concept since the invention of the refrigerator, try to answer one of the following questions instead:</p><ol><li>What is a carburetor in relation to a car?</li><li>What is the difference between a seed and a nut?</li><li>What would hurt more, 220 watts or 220 volts of electricity?</li><li>What is lactose in reference to lactose intolerance? Is it a protein or a carb or something else?</li><li>What part of the animal is a tenderloin. Follow up question, what animal is it?</li></ol><p>I’ll be very surprised to find anyone born any time after 1980 who didn’t have to Google at least some of these [every day] concepts.</p><p>If you made it this far, you’re probably thinking one of two things.</p><blockquote>The education system is dropping the ball on us. The world is going to shit.</blockquote><blockquote>Whatever. Who cares what a carburetor is anyway? I drive a Tesla.</blockquote><p>I’d like to address each of these separately. First, if you agree that this knowledge is good to have, it’s very tempting to find a reason why we are missing it. Blaming it on some sort of institution is the easy way out. Unfortunately, I am not convinced it’s always an education problem.</p><p>For example, I didn’t know what a carburetor was because I never owned a car myself. I heard others talk about it because their car broke down and it was identified as a possible cause. However, unless you’re into cars or bikes, or you have some fascination with fixing motors, you probably didn’t know what a carburetor was either. It’s very possible you never even heard of this part.</p><p>There’s a good reason for that. It’s because of how we address problems. If smoke is coming out of the front hood of my car on the highway, instead of stopping by the side of the road, popping the hood and trying to identify the problem, I am going to pick up my phone and call a tow truck to take it to nearest mechanic. Once the work is complete, I’ll swipe my plastic and drive home. Transaction complete. Where was my opportunity to learn about the internals of an engine?</p><p>From an economic point of view, this is a great story. Imagine if this wasn’t the case. What if you didn’t have access to qualified people in different fields. Instead you had to learn how to do everything yourself. It becomes impossible to be a good mechanic, electrician, plumber, programmer and dietician at the same time. There just isn’t enough time (and skill). Through specialization, you are able to gain access to experts in many fields for an affordable price. The mechanic has mastery in her field so you don’t have to. You are now free to concentrate on enterprises that you are more productive in.</p><p>Of course it comes at a price. As our society becomes increasingly specialized, our breadth of knowledge becomes more narrow. This is natural since we are outsourcing so much of the “other” work to experts in their own fields. That’s why I don’t know much (anything) about electricity or plumbing but I know a thing or two about web development. You can take this to a not so unimaginable extreme where your average nuclear astrophysicist is unable to make herself breakfast because she doesn’t know how to boil an egg.</p><p>A second position one could take is that this information is useless anyway. A larder is useless because you have a fridge. A carburetor is useless because you have an electric car. Seeds and nuts are useless because you can always get your fruits from Costco and so on. This is also a flawed argument for a very similar reason.</p><p>It is unlikely that knowing the answer to any of the 5 questions posed earlier would directly impact your life in any way. It could, but it’s very unlikely. However, there’s a certain knowledge base that is significantly common within regular life. Things that come up frequently. This is a sign that you should be familiar with them. For example, it is likely that you were familiar with most, if not all the terms in the questions even if you were unable to answer them without Googling. That’s because volts and lactose are quite common in everyday life.</p><p>Once you spend enough time learning about the basics, life becomes easier. Changing a light switch in the house isn’t a big deal anymore. If the toilet isn’t flushing the way you’d like, no need to call a plumber. If you’re told you are eating a tenderloin, you don’t need to wonder if it’s white meat or dark meat. All sorts of options open up for you.</p><p>Another advantage to knowing your basics well is that others can’t feed you lies, or if they are trying, you have a good radar calibrated to detect just that. In a world where flexible truth prances around masquerading as facts on every corner, this is an incredibly helpful skill to have. For example, it would be much harder for a mechanic to over charge you if you had at least a basic understanding of what could be wrong.</p><p>By hyper-specializing in a certain space you are potentially robbing yourself of these opportunities. Why shouldn’t a web a developer know how to garden? For that matter, why shouldn’t a gardener know how a website works. This isn’t proprietary information and the lessons could be invaluable for all. I would personally love to pick my own tomatoes while I’m sure my gardener would love to update the pricing on his website without my involvement.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b4b4c8e60535\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/hyper-specialization-vs-knowing-stuff-b4b4c8e60535\">Hyper-specialization vs. Knowing stuff</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I highly recommend that you take those three and a half minutes of your hectic and extremely busy life to watch it. Of course, the quote above gives you a reasonable summary as well.</p><p>As an employee in most corporations, you’ve likely run into the idea of having a mentor at work. Someone who is senior to you, frequently older or more experienced. They are expected to share their knowledge with you to help you progress in your career. This is a wonderful system (at least in theory) since we can learn from past mistakes and seek advice from more accomplished colleagues.</p><p>It sounds great for those 40 hours a week you spend at work. What about the other 72 awake hours you have? How come we don’t seek out mentors for that larger portion of our lives? Of course, if you do, more power to you. I personally don’t know anyone who has successfully maintained such a relationship.</p><p>This brings me back to the video above. Since about the age of 20, I’ve been reading all sorts of non-fiction. I never had a good reason to. I just knew that I enjoyed it. Since watching the video, The idea of mentorship opened my eyes to much deeper reasoning. Here is why.</p><p>Each time you read a book, you get to pick a topic, any topic and learn from a world class expert in the field about all the lessons and mistakes they’ve encountered, in a concise and rigorous way. The book can usually be consumed in about 7–30 days. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Books are the ideal kind of mentorship. Through the filter of time and amazon reviews, all the garbage will die out and you’ll be left with the gems. The topic is up to you. The depth of the topic is up to you. The quantity is also up to you. Finally, the schedule is up to you. No single human mentor can live up to that.</p><p>Feel free to follow me on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24781484-leon-tager\">GoodReads</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f54d4f8ec845\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-you-should-read-daily-f54d4f8ec845\">Why you should read daily</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Hashtags were flying around with snazzy slogans celebrating unity and harmony, identity and integrity and all sorts of other hippy war cries. We got to talk about the company’s future direction and gossip about internal politics.</p><p>Once each day came to a close, we headed to the restaurants to eat the finest Pad Thai San Francisco had to offer. We all had a daily allowance and I’ll be damned if I didn’t use it! On the last day, we had a giant party with unlimited tequila shots and a fish taco stand.</p><p>That night, I downed my fifth fluid ounce of tequila and headed straight for my friend Colin who was in the midst of a deep conversation with Nina and Zack. I don’t know what they were talking about, but I overheard the following phrase</p><blockquote>Your actions reflect your values</blockquote><p>Cool, I thought. Heard that one before. Nothing new. I’ll take that beer now.</p><p>Once the party was over, I stumbled my way to the hotel and passed out.</p><p>The next day I woke up at 10am with a pounding headache.

I worked hard on my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a> to use my time wisely. I found plenty of time to browse nonsense on the internet throughout that week. I did not however find time to call my mother.</p><p>If the statement above is true — if actions dictate your values — my values are… off. They are certainly not what I expected them to be.</p><p>I am glad Colin brought up that phrase. Thanks to him, I had a mini-epiphany while nursing my hangover.</p><p>Up to last week, my <strong>values</strong> dictated my <strong>actions </strong>— up to a point. Occasionally, I would give myself a break from being good … and be bad. I would drink a little too much. I would browse YouTube a little too long. I would get into an argument on Twitter a little too fast.</p><p>The new me prefaces these “undesirable” behaviours with the following question:</p><blockquote>Does this action reflect my values?</blockquote><p>Does drinking a pint of beer reflect my values?

Amidst all the distraction from the likes of Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, one may ask how is it possible to stay productive at all?</p><p>In my mind, there are many things that need to be my attention. However, I usually have a tendency to delay things as long as possible. People call it many things, but I call it <em>laziness. </em>😖</p><p>It could be writing a Medium article, finishing up a chunk of code, reviewing a technical document, or just replying to an email. When I’m left to my own devices, I would basically imagine all these things in my head and feel the insurmountable amount of work that needs done…</p><p>When that grim mood sets in, my hand would instinctively reach into my pocket and pull out my phone.</p><p>This had happened to me multiple times in the past, and it still does from time to time.</p><p>But something <em>changed</em>. Once I discovered the secret cure to counter this terrible disease, I’ve been able to be 10x more productive than before, and as a direct result, bring much more joy into my life. My steps have springs in them, and my every waking day I feel a sense of mission and accomplishment.</p><p>Now, let me share with you my personal secret weapon to increase productivity.</p><h3>MOMENTUM</h3><p>That’s it, I said it. Momentum. It’s a simple word, but a powerful force.</p><blockquote>Momentum is what picks you up when you’re down, keeps you going when you’re overwhelmed, and maintains your focus when you sense distraction.</blockquote><blockquote>Momentum gets rid of triviality, and drives action.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Momentum is the power to produce.</strong></blockquote><p>When I sense that my energy level is low, and yet there are heaps of stuff left to be done, I give myself a mental pat on the back and start with one simple goal: <strong>do one thing at a time</strong>.</p><p>Let me give you an example. I started writing this article on a Tuesday evening at 10.10pm after work. I had just worked out, cleaned up the place and felt really tired.</p><p>Yet, I promised my editor (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a>) that I’ll write at least an article this week to demonstrate mindful living in my own life.</p><p>After I sat down on my bed, my first thought was, <em>“Hmm, there are other, better things I can do with my time. Let’s see what’s on Facebook before I get started…”</em></p><p>One thing led to another, and 10 minutes later I was<em> still</em> on Facebook. How often has this happened to you?</p><p>That’s when I told myself, <em>“OK, let’s try just one paragraph. Let’s see what happens…”</em></p><p>That’s the magic phrase,<strong> <em>let’s see what happens</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>Once you start doing something, the powerful magic of momentum will carry you forward without you knowing it.</p><p>Fast-forward 20 minutes later, and I’ve already written close to 500 words. Much of it will probably be edited out in post-processing, but that’s OK. I have outdone myself, and wrote more than what I set out to do.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important thing is to realize that productivity doesn’t mean getting things done to perfection. Productivity, to me, <strong>means to execute and follow-through</strong>. Getting something out there is much better than nothing at all.</p><p>Once you have momentum behind you, it is much easier to follow that flow and drive things to completion.</p><h3>Tips &amp; Tricks for Building Momentum</h3><p>Here is a list of tips &amp; tricks I use to build momentum in my daily life:</p><ul><li>I <strong>block out a chunk of time</strong> on my calendar every day for my own space. For example, on my work calendar, there’s a chunk of time from 3–5pm that is allocated for coding. I have understanding teammates who don’t book meetings on those power-hours because it’s important for me to keep sanity and have time to myself to do things I need to do.</li><li><strong>Fill in mundane tasks with something productive</strong>. Reading more books is one of my goals for this year. When I feel overwhelmed and need to get away, I’ll try to pull out a book or listen to an audiobook on Spotify. I have a book in my backpack at all times, and having something to put my mind into is very helpful in those situations. The goal here <strong>is to build a productive habit</strong>, and you can replace reading with something else like working out or taking out the trash.</li><li><strong>Set a schedule and stick to it.</strong> Working out is something I dread, yet it’s important for my overall health. Earlier this year when I sat down and analyzed why I wasn’t working out more, I realized that having to drive to the gym and mentally set myself in work-out mode was time-consuming and counter-productive. What I did, then, was I built my own little home gym. My small gym only has some free weights and a bench, but the effects are tremendous. Every day, I’ll spend 30–40 minutes in the gym either lifting or doing a quick jog. Again, I build momentum here by just showing up. <strong>80% of the battle is already won when you show up, and that’s the beauty of momentum</strong>.</li></ul><p>Those are just some examples of how I use momentum in my daily life to drive productivity. I’d like to know if you have any productivity tips to share as well!</p><h3>Credits</h3><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> for proof-reading and providing valuable feedback!</p><p><em>Zhia Chong is a student of mindful living.

But, to be more mindful, you need to practice more meditation. Hence, at the beginning, you may not even be aware of the small changes. The progress is still under the soil.</p><p>One does not simply count their breaths to unlock the power of meditation.</p><h3><strong>Get the logistic right</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>I recommend to use guided meditation.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> is great for the beginner because it repeatedly walks through the core practices <em>(see below)</em>.</li><li><strong>Sit up right.</strong> <em>Laying down meditation never works (I tried).</em></li><li><strong>Meditate for at least 10 minutes.</strong> The mind needs enough time to calm down and adjust to the practice.</li><li><strong>Do it everyday.</strong> This is the most important rule. At the beginning, skipping one day felt almost like starting over again. Leverage the <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">power of habits</a> to see progress faster.</li></ul><h3><strong>Understand the core concept</strong></h3><p>We practice mindfulness in one of two ways: focused attention and open monitoring. They are quite different but both are essential.</p><ul><li><strong>Focused attention exercise </strong>can be done by focusing on one object like breathing. Buddhist monk practices mindful walking; paying attention to the feet that touch the ground, and the weight that pulls down due to gravity.</li></ul><blockquote><em>Focused attention exercise is helpful to sharpen the focus and overcome the distraction in day-to-day life.</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Open monitoring</strong> can be done by being aware of any sensation, thought or emotion that emerge without being attached to it. Instead of focusing on a particular object, keep the mind open to any sensations. See it appear and let it goes without processing it.</li></ul><blockquote>Open monitoring is helpful to let go of any present emotion, attachment to the past, and expectation of the future, which consumes our energy unnecessarily.</blockquote><h3><strong>Benefit</strong></h3><p>I found that practicing mindfulness strengthens the ability to follow my own thought process to a great extent. <strong>I can reach to a deeper reasoning and watch closely how ego and emotion influence any action or decision. </strong>Mindfulness also gives the clarity to my subconscious thought such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity, which are the root of my reasoning flaw. Taking time to practice mindfulness is not only important but necessary in this chaotic society.</p><p>Like physical exercise, meditation is the exercise of the mind. It will takes the regular practice for months to get the six-pack mind.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e62e00b57368\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-meditation-doesnt-work-e62e00b57368\">Why meditation doesn’t work</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It will follow a slightly modified style of my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/grading-my-resolutions-for-2017-4bc46a18c7ec\">2017 resolutions</a> but will stick to the same principles as described <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-favourite-part-of-new-year-c043c0e69e97\">in my favourite part of new year</a>. One tweak that I’m attempting is to create a generic topic that I want to concentrate on (but not grade) and grade myself only on the action items.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>Let’s start with the big one. After all, it’s the most important thing you’ve got. This year, it’s also the most loaded category of resolutions.</p><ul><li><strong>Eat a big bowl of salad for lunch</strong></li></ul><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2F149sixr2mzlBrq%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F149sixr2mzlBrq%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F149sixr2mzlBrq%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=giphy\" width=\"435\" height=\"244\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/23e83e127a952d1c2700aadbab20b5f6/href\">https://medium.com/media/23e83e127a952d1c2700aadbab20b5f6/href</a></iframe><p>I don’t expect to have any trouble with the above. I bought myself a nice big bowl of salad and I make sure to fill it up every day. I highly encourage everyone to eat their leafy greens.</p><ul><li><strong>Zero alcohol at home</strong></li><li><strong>Two drink limit during social gatherings</strong></li><li><strong>Intermittent fast 3 times a week</strong></li></ul><p>I think the details of how I do intermittent fasting is out of the scope of this article but the basic idea is restricted eating for 8 hours a day.</p><ul><li><strong>Limit coffee consumption to two cups a day</strong></li></ul><p>This makes me a little sad 😔. I love my coffee but I noticed that when I don’t have it, I start feeling very tired. I don’t like the idea of being dependent on a substance. Another option is try decaf or tea.</p><h3>Minimalism</h3><p>I couldn’t come up with more then one resolution for this category (appropriately). I think that since last year’s clean up, we’re pretty reasonable with how much things we accumulate. There’s certainly rooms that could use some re-evaluation but overall I can’t complain.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay item neutral</strong></li></ul><p>This one is short and easy. I’ll expand on item neutrality separately but the basic idea is simple. One item in, one item out.</p><h3>Reading</h3><p>Each book is someone’s lifetime accumulation of knowledge and experience condensed into a few hours of the most valuable lessons. It’s a great way to learn from gurus about any topic without ever having to meet them. Unfortunately I’m a slow a reader. Therefore; my goal isn’t anything super ambitious but definitely respectable.</p><ul><li><strong>Read 16 books in a year</strong></li></ul><p>I track my reading on Goodreads. That way I know exactly how many books I’ve read. Also, I don’t have to finish the book to count it. Some books are not very good but as long as I got through a significant portion of it I’ll add it to the count.</p><ul><li><strong>Replace unproductive activities with reading</strong></li></ul><p>Unproductive activities is quite broad but they tend to boil down to some sort of passive consumption of entertainment; things like TV, netflix, news, and tech websites.</p><h3>Fitness</h3><p>Unlike prior years, I didn’t wait until January to start going to the gym. Turns out, there’s a gym right in the building where I work so it’s extremely convenient. Also, I didn’t create any insurmountable goal. I found that consistency seems to be far more useful here than impressive ambitions.</p><ul><li><strong>Go to the gym twice a week</strong></li></ul><p>I have a simple exercise plan but it will probably fluctuate throughout the year. Mainly I’m focused on showing up at the gym. Once I’m there, lifting weights is the easy part.</p><h3>Mindfulness</h3><p>This is a completely new category for me. I tried a half-ass attempt at mindfulness earlier in 2017 but not ruminating about the past, planning for the future or recreating hypothetical events in your head, is harder to do then it first seems. I was introduced to the concept a while back but what really brought it to my attention is an honest account by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harris_%28journalist%29\">Dan Harris</a> on the path he took to start meditating.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0062265431/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062265431&amp;linkCode=am2&amp;tag=opensourcep0f-20&amp;linkId=105ef298c61e8862304dc4004f44a5f3\">Amazon.com: Buying Choices: 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works--A True Story</a></p><p>Since this is a new area for me, and I recognize how tough it is, I’m starting small for this year.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t pull out your phone without a reason</strong></li></ul><p>You stand in line at Trader Joe’s and you pull out your iPhone, slide the screens to the right, then to the left, check your email, and then put it back in your pocket. In the meantime achieving nothing. I see this all the time. Checking your phone for the sake of keeping your mind busy. I want to be okay with boredom.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay present during walks</strong></li></ul><p>I tend to walk a lot. I walk to work and to get groceries. I walk a minimum of 10,000 steps in a day. I don’t need 10,000 different conversations going through my head though. The idea is to try and stay present while outdoors. It’s somewhat arbitrary but I think it will be useful for two reasons. First, walking is a regular activity. Therefore; I’ll get a regular reminder to try and stay present. Second, the duration of the walks tends to be a reasonable amount of time for me to practice this new skill.</p><ul><li><strong>Stop doing two things at once</strong></li></ul><p>Mainly, I’m thinking about eating and browsing at the same time. Although I’m sure there’s plenty of other activities that I multi-task on. It seems like a great idea on the surface. You can finish twice as many things in the same time. However, I think it’s just another symptom of restlessness and the fear of boredom that infects us.</p><h3>Personal</h3><p>I generally like myself, but there’s one thing that really drives me crazy. I hate how I’m constantly late to meet people. It is so bad that our friends now expect us to show up late. It’s an inside joke to see if we show up on time or not. So my resolution for the year is simple.</p><ul><li><strong>Stop being late</strong></li></ul><p>I’m going to need some flexibility here. First, it’s culturally appropriate to be late. It’s even termed “fashionably late”. If that’s the expectation, I wouldn’t want to show up on time and surprise the hosts. Second, I cannot always control when we leave the house. If my wife isn’t ready, I don’t think she would appreciate me leaving the house without her. Therefore; as long as I am dressed and ready to go on time, I’ll consider that a win. It’s just a good habit to have.</p><p>That’s all for me for 2018. What do you think of these resolutions? Are they achievable and specific enough? Is there anything that I missed?</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8e10476e7640\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">Commitments for 2018</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

No more would I have to suffer through slow talking TED talks or horribly paced tutorials on trivial matters. It’s really been a godsend for my learning. In fact, check out my YouTube viewing as a percentage of my overall surfing:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*YCdtOxtNC0Fu3Zx6wwvboA.png\" /></figure><p>That’s almost a quarter of all my surfing!! Second in it’s place is Twitter which I’m not as proud of.</p><p>Now for the longest time I felt reasonably good about this. I always justified this behaviour by saying that this is for learning. I was technically wasting my time because I was constantly learning something new. This is actually true. There was no way I could consume as much content otherwise.</p><p>Recently though, my wife brought up the objection that if I keep watching my videos on x1.5 speed, I’ll rewire my brain to expect everything to be done that way. I’ll start talking faster; I’ll expect other to talk faster; and most importantly I’ll have a lot less patience.</p><p>Initially, I tried to tell her that it is fine because I only watch informational videos at x1.5 speed and entertainment is still at regular speed. I was just trying to pick up facts. Therefore; there was no need to slow it down. Additionally, I didn’t feel like I really had a problem and could easily slow it down and just watch less videos.</p><p>So I tried it. Today. I switched back to normal speed and played through some of my regular subscriptions. The first thing I noticed is how slow everyone seemed to talk. In fact, there were some people I’ve never even heard talking at a normal rate before.</p><p>The second thing I noticed was how hard it was sometimes to just keep listening. I had this urge to do something while they were explaining. It felt like they just couldn’t quite get to the point fast enough for my liking. I’d find myself skipping ahead a few times just to realize I missed some content and then having to backtrack.</p><p>Finally, when I got more accustomed to the speed, I realized how calming it is to listen to someone talk at a regular speed. No one was rushing anywhere and the world wasn’t on fire. They were just saying what they wanted to say and I was an observer.</p><p>I think I might still reserve the x1.5 speed option for certain things. Maybe I’ll do it for technical presentations or something that tends to be extra boring. But the general rule for me now is to listen to people talk they way they intended to be heard.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1053293e03ad\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/slow-it-down-1053293e03ad\">Slow it down</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s important to qualify what it means. I think that a lot of people hear about this concept and assume right away that you are depriving yourself of things. Deprivation also takes a lot of will power. So even if someone thinks they can live with the deprivation, they are sure they’ll fail due to lack of will power.</p><p>I want to tell you that it’s completely wrong. There is no need for any will power what so ever (In fact, that’s a recipe for disaster but I digress. I’ll leave that for a later post). What it does take is a change in the state of mind. You must understand that having more does not mean being happier. That’s something that you must also internalize.</p><p>Internalizing this concept is beyond the scope of this article but it’s an absolute must. Once you do, everything else becomes so easy. It’s just so intuitive and second nature to dump the stuff you don’t use. And as you dump it, you clear the house, you lower your mental maintenance cost and you lower your anxiety level. This becomes a reinforcing loop.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you approach this from the view of deprivation, you’ll fail quickly. All you’ll see is all the things you’re missing while glossing over all the freedom you gained and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@osportfolio/how-to-make-life-better-71db900e82e3\">happiness by subtraction</a>.</p><p>My articles are rarely some sort of cohesive set of ideas that you can follow along with but I love how all these ideas from the FI community, minimalism, and happiness really overlap and come together so well. It proves to me once again that these are all correct. It’s sort of like science when you have a hypothesis about something and based on this hypothesis you keep seeing evidence in real life. It just makes your hypothesis that much more likely to be true.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1a3721e3abcf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">Minimalism and deprivation</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, my perfectionist wife has been setting up the room for a month prior to that. The possibility of someone giving us a three star rating is just too much to bear. Thankfully, we’ve been getting only five star ratings so far.</p><p>To ensure the five star rating keeps coming, we’ve had to go through each corner of the basement and clear it out, rearrange the furniture and fix any outstanding nagging maintenance issues. As a result, we’ve taken several trunk-loads of stuff straight to Goodwill — mostly random junk that was packed away in the basement, forgotten about and collecting dust.</p><p>The basement was also the place where our TV lived. We do not have another one upstairs. It is also the place where I kept my clothes. My wife graciously allowed me to keep my stuff in the basement while she took over the bedroom closet. It incorporated my own private bathroom as well. We’ve never had to worry where to keep my shaving paraphernalia versus her hair products.</p><p>Since we’ve started renting the basement, things had to change. We’ve shifted from having 1600 square feet to 900. My clothes moved upstairs. We’ve had to isolate a small corner in the closet for me. The bathrooms were unified (it is going through a clean up process as I am writing this). There’s also no more television.</p><blockquote>Essentially, we’ve forced ourselves into adopting a certain level of minimalism.</blockquote><p>Minimalism was never the intention when considering Airbnb. Instead, I was always thinking about our TTF (time to financial independence). That’s because Airbnb is the classic example of passivish income (I made that up). Your existing asset (the house) is doing most of the heavy lifting. You just need to remember to pay the bills. The more you automate, the more passive it becomes.</p><p>One glance around here and you’ll know right away that I am a huge fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">minimalism</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/tagged/intentional-living\">intentional living</a>. That’s why it came to me as a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise when I realized I am forced to downsize substantially.</p><p>Before you jump to conclusions, this is not some personality disorder or twisted reasoning. I am not actively trying to induce self-harm. This is a very conscious decision. Ponder this idea of <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/happiness-through-subtraction/\">happiness through subtraction</a> for example to see where I’m coming from. If you’re still not convinced, that’s fine. I’ll have a lot more to say about minimalism in the future.</p><p>In the mean time, for anyone thinking about their TTF, you should know there are some unintended consequences to Airbnb that go well beyond the money; intentional minimalism happens to be one of them.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=53c7a6122982\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/surprise-unintended-consequences-of-airbnb-hosting-53c7a6122982\">Surprising unintended consequences of Airbnb hosting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In this case, this honour falls on my good friend Nick. Nick is a great guy. He is super smart. He is always looking to grow as an individual. Most importantly, he is open minded. We also happen to share a lot of interest in the world of personal finance, minimalism and happiness.</p><p>Nick and I decided to grab a bite at a wonderful Mexican establishment in the city. We sat down, ordered our drinks and chatted about what we’ve been up to recently. Turns out, he’s been reading <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com\">Mr. Money Mustache</a>’s blog for the last couple of weeks and really likes it. He’s just got one concern. Apparently, “Mr. Money Mustache (Pete) is too extreme”.</p><p>Specifically, he was bothered by the idea that Pete hasn’t spent any money on clothing in an entire year (at least according to his <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/05/19/2016-spending/\">budget</a>). Pete’s choices of clothing revolved around free event t-shirts and some fashion advice from Costco. This did not resonate well with Nick. His look is much more sophisticated. Therefore; that idea of spending less on clothing was outright rejected.</p><p>I tried to reason with him. I told him that spending more on clothing won’t necessarily make him any happier (the happiness argument); that we tend to have piles of clothes we don’t know what to do with (the minimalism argument); that it’s a depreciating good we waste our money on but adds very little value (the money argument) and so on. Nothing worked. I just wasn’t getting through to him.</p><p>That left me wondering. How could a perfectly rational person not realize that not spending thousands of dollars a year on clothing is a perfectly legitimate way of living?</p><p>Of course, this article is not about a particular incident but an illustration of a much more common phenomena. It’s the phenomena of being presented with a perfectly valid argument for a great idea but failing to accept the (implied) conclusion. In other words, a great idea is rejected due to errors in judgment. So, after some deeper contemplation and inner examination I realized there are three distinct reasons someone could reject an idea.</p><p><strong>The idea is too novice. </strong>You have probably experienced this before. Someone is giving you advice on a topic you are far more familiar with. The idea is rudimentary, which you’ve considered many times before and dismissed for good reasons. For example, if you’ve just learned the difference between a traditional and Roth 401k, don’t bother telling me about all the benefits of Roth. I’ve already considered them and chose to go with the traditional route.</p><p>It is not because your idea is bad or assumptions are wrong. In fact, it’s great that you took the time to learn the difference (most people don’t). It’s because I’ve done plenty of research on the topic and I’m comfortable with the concept. Roth is not a bad option. However, in many cases, the traditional route can be more advantageous. It’s a conscious decision.</p><p>The best part is that you know perfectly well when this is your reason for rejecting someone’s idea. You know it because you see the conclusion coming from a mile away. This is the best place to be since there is practically no risk that you are making a mistake. It is <strong>not</strong> a judgment error.</p><p><strong>“Limiting beliefs” are stopping me from adopting this idea. </strong>I’ll be honest. I borrowed this phrase from <a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-invisible-scripts-that-guide-our-lives/\">Ramit Sethi</a> but the idea stands! This is actually a very deep concept that requires it’s own article. However, for the sake of clarity I will summarize it as follows:</p><blockquote>It is the silent beliefs carried with you that dictate your actions. These beliefs tell you what you <strong>can’t</strong> do.</blockquote><p>It’s a very powerful concept and I encourage everyone to explore it further (or wait for a follow up article). To further illustrate this, imagine being overweight your entire life. Obtaining a muscular physique is likely out of the realm of possibilities; mostly because you don’t believe you can achieve it. The number of excuses can be endless. You can blame it on your genes; or your parents; or your hungry BFF. The common theme here is that you believe it’s out of your control. Therefore; a limiting belief and an a likely error in judgment.</p><p><strong>The idea conflicts with my life choices. </strong>When this happens, you must toy with the possibility that there was an error in your perception of the world; possibly your entire adult life; and at the risk of facing some serious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\">cognitive dissonance</a>. A second option is to find any and every possible reason to explain why that particular idea cannot work for you in your particular circumstances. The second option is the road most often taken.</p><p>For instance, imagine we are talking about transportation and I am trying to convince you that you don’t need a car. I’ll tell you about all the wonderful environmental benefits of not owning a car; the cash you’ll save; the exercise you’ll get; the longer life you’ll enjoy. I’ll even present you with alternative modes of transportation you can use such as a bike or bus. I’ll even throw in the time you’ll free up to read just like you always wanted so you could be the person you always thought you should be.</p><p>What will your reaction be? If you’re considering this idea, You have two choices. Either you must admit to yourself that maybe you’re not that savvy, discerning, environmentally friendly consumer you’ve always thought you were. You must also admit that since you’ve started working, your commute was irrational. Alternatively, you can come up with every reason why that can’t possibly work for you. The bus is irregular and unreliable. The bike can get a flat and you don’t know how to fix it. You can’t be late to work and your Uber driver can get lost in your neighbourhood. Thus; you justify the status quo instead of facing the hard truth.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is distinctly different from a limiting belief. You are not rejecting the idea because of some “invisible script” running your life. You are rejecting the idea because its conclusion is too hard to bear.</p><p>What’s interesting about this error in judgement is how easy it is to identify it. All you have to do is look at your immediate reaction. Are you looking for a list of excuses as to why this won’t work for you? Is someone challenging your assumption and it’s making you uncomfortable? Welcome my friend. You’re experiencing cognitive dissonance and you might want to reconsider your stance.</p><p>I have definitely used all three reasons when rejecting great ideas. Now that I’ve identified them, I hope it will be easier for me (and you) to notice them and make better decisions.</p><p>If you’re wondering, I think my friend Nick was experiencing a conflict with his life choices. I’m sure he knows that spending thousands on clothing is not necessarily in his best interest. He also knows that money would be better spent buying an index fund. However, to admit that, he would also need to admit that he wasted thousands of dollars in the last 10 years. That would contradict his view of himself as a savvy consumer. Hence, it’s easier to argue that refraining from spending thousands on clothes is extreme. Of course, this is assuming that what Mr. Money Mustache does is a good idea.</p><p><strong>addendum</strong></p><p>Read <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nimatohid/does-what-you-wear-matter-93170ed251fe\">the Tohidian</a> for Nick’s rebuttal.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=558c843eb939\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">Why would anyone reject a good idea</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

All <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-favourite-part-of-new-year-c043c0e69e97\">resolutions and steps</a> are listed together with a semi-monthly grade. Overall, I must admit that I am happy with my performance this year. This was the first year that I tried this and it worked out really well. I highly recommend everyone to try it for 2018.</p><p>The way I’ve presented it here is the overall goal is bolded and the steps that I’ve taken and graded myself on are underneath. Each column represents two months. I’ve started the year by giving myself a grade between A-F but in April switched to a numbered system. It seemed more intuitive.</p><p>Also, you’ll see a dash in some places. Those could mean one of two things. Either it’s a goal that I’ve decided is not worth pursuing anymore or it’s a goal that I came up with mid year and did not have data points from earlier.</p><h4><strong>Minimize the number of items that I own</strong></h4><pre>╔═════════════════════════╦════╦═══╦════╦════╦════╦═══╗<br>║ Each item has a purpose ║ A  ║ B ║  7 ║  8 ║  8 ║ - ║<br>║ Stay item neutral       ║ A+ ║ A ║ 10 ║ 10 ║ 10 ║ 9 ║<br>╚═════════════════════════╩════╩═══╩════╩════╩════╩═══╝</pre><p><strong><em>Bottom line:</em></strong> Last quantile started off rough as we were accumulating a lot of stuff but we ended the last week of the year by donating a lot to Goodwill.

Nor is it second since I’ve never established the first one. It’s more of an observation that I had recently regarding minimalist living and why it works.</p><p>Now, you’re probably vaguely familiar or remember the idea of the second law of thermodynamics. To summarize it in a non-sciencey way, it’s essentially the idea that things tend towards disorder unless outside energy is applied. A good example of this is taking a bath. Initially, it is all nice and hot but after a while you realize the water has cooled down because the heat has escaped.</p><p>So what does that have to do with minimalism? I think you can draw a neat parallel between thermodynamics and ownership of things (or obligations). It’s also a great way to better understand two things</p><ol><li>Why are you unhappy with everything you have</li><li>How can having less possibly make you happier</li></ol><p>Let’s imagine yourself owning a very basic set of dishes. You have nothing beyond a single plate, knife, fork and spoon. Also, washing dishes isn’t exactly your favourite activity. Life is pretty tough. What can we do to improve it?</p><p>One thing we can do is add a cup. Now you’re able to enjoy water comfortably instead of trying to collect it in your hands. Sounds pretty great no? Your happiness should improve dramatically. I have no doubt that drinking water without a cup is adding a lot of unnecessary inefficiency to your life. This is also the overall thought process that people go through when determining if they need to purchase something or not.</p><p>But there’s one thing we’ve overlooked. We forgot to account for the cost of maintenance for this item. I use maintenance as a general form to refer to actions like storing the item, washing the item and finding the item. All trivial indeed but don’t forget, all we have is one set of everything. In this case, the trivial maintenance cost is just that. Trivial.</p><p>Maintenance becomes a problem as the number of items that you own increases. Each of them providing a diminishing return for your convenience but increases the maintenance somewhat linearly. For example, getting another cup would mean another person can have a drink with me but all the above maintenance costs just doubled.</p><p>This maintenance cost comes to us in two primary forms. The first is at the cost of our time. We have to spend time washing the cup and putting it away. But also, it comes in the form of mental clutter. This will arise when you don’t take care of the maintenance tasks immediately and they start pilling up.</p><p>You can extrapolate this further to all the items that you own. And you own A LOT. Like thousands a lot. Each may take 1–10 seconds in maintenance on average so together it takes a significant chunk of your day. And before you realize it, you spend a significant portion of your free time just putting things back together, finishing up unfinished projects and just basic cleaning. No wonder you don’t have any time.</p><p>The second law of minimalism is this:</p><blockquote>Everything has it’s cost. Make sure you understand it well</blockquote><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c487f90a8ff3\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/second-law-of-minimalism-c487f90a8ff3\">Second law of minimalism</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I find the idea very attractive. And it seems <a href=\"https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp01-mobile-phone/\">I’m not the only one either</a>. It will ensure that my phone usage decreases dramatically while still giving me a way out in case I’m in trouble or if someone is looking to reach me.</p><p>The problem is that dumb phones are missing certain key apps that I rely on heavily. For example, I like having Google maps for orientation. I mentioned this idea to my wife and to my surprise she questioned my basic assumptions. She asked me when was the last time I was suddenly lost. Could I not look up my path prior to going there and print out the directions? You know, like we used to do.</p><p>That’s a valid point. I think I like the idea of having maps a lot more then I actually need them. I’m certain there’s very few instances that I suddenly needed them because of some unforeseen circumstances. So what’s really holding me back?</p><p>Another thing I could think of was various messengers I use to communicate with my friends around the country. That one is a little tougher since everyone have their messenger of choice and platform fragmentation isn’t helping the situation. At any one time I have 3 messengers running to talk to different groups of people. I’m not trying to claim it’s unsolvable problem but it’s definitely inconvenient.</p><p>In her eternal brilliance, my wife asked me, what was actually bothering on my smartphone? In other words, what was I spending most of my time on? I admitted that it was email. I like to check it far more often then I should.

Another thing that I try to avoid when I’m <strong>not</strong> around people is to stick my face in my smartphone.

No more would I have to suffer through slow talking TED talks or horribly paced tutorials on trivial matters. It’s really been a godsend for my learning. In fact, check out my YouTube viewing as a percentage of my overall surfing:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*YCdtOxtNC0Fu3Zx6wwvboA.png\" /></figure><p>That’s almost a quarter of all my surfing!! Second in it’s place is Twitter which I’m not as proud of.</p><p>Now for the longest time I felt reasonably good about this. I always justified this behaviour by saying that this is for learning. I was technically wasting my time because I was constantly learning something new. This is actually true. There was no way I could consume as much content otherwise.</p><p>Recently though, my wife brought up the objection that if I keep watching my videos on x1.5 speed, I’ll rewire my brain to expect everything to be done that way. I’ll start talking faster; I’ll expect other to talk faster; and most importantly I’ll have a lot less patience.</p><p>Initially, I tried to tell her that it is fine because I only watch informational videos at x1.5 speed and entertainment is still at regular speed. I was just trying to pick up facts. Therefore; there was no need to slow it down. Additionally, I didn’t feel like I really had a problem and could easily slow it down and just watch less videos.</p><p>So I tried it. Today. I switched back to normal speed and played through some of my regular subscriptions. The first thing I noticed is how slow everyone seemed to talk. In fact, there were some people I’ve never even heard talking at a normal rate before.</p><p>The second thing I noticed was how hard it was sometimes to just keep listening. I had this urge to do something while they were explaining. It felt like they just couldn’t quite get to the point fast enough for my liking. I’d find myself skipping ahead a few times just to realize I missed some content and then having to backtrack.</p><p>Finally, when I got more accustomed to the speed, I realized how calming it is to listen to someone talk at a regular speed. No one was rushing anywhere and the world wasn’t on fire.

It’s important to qualify what it means. I think that a lot of people hear about this concept and assume right away that you are depriving yourself of things. Deprivation also takes a lot of will power. So even if someone thinks they can live with the deprivation, they are sure they’ll fail due to lack of will power.</p><p>I want to tell you that it’s completely wrong. There is no need for any will power what so ever (In fact, that’s a recipe for disaster but I digress. I’ll leave that for a later post). What it does take is a change in the state of mind. You must understand that having more does not mean being happier. That’s something that you must also internalize.</p><p>Internalizing this concept is beyond the scope of this article but it’s an absolute must. Once you do, everything else becomes so easy. It’s just so intuitive and second nature to dump the stuff you don’t use. And as you dump it, you clear the house, you lower your mental maintenance cost and you lower your anxiety level. This becomes a reinforcing loop.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you approach this from the view of deprivation, you’ll fail quickly. All you’ll see is all the things you’re missing while glossing over all the freedom you gained and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@osportfolio/how-to-make-life-better-71db900e82e3\">happiness by subtraction</a>.</p><p>My articles are rarely some sort of cohesive set of ideas that you can follow along with but I love how all these ideas from the FI community, minimalism, and happiness really overlap and come together so well. It proves to me once again that these are all correct. It’s sort of like science when you have a hypothesis about something and based on this hypothesis you keep seeing evidence in real life. It just makes your hypothesis that much more likely to be true.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1a3721e3abcf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/minimalism-and-deprivation-1a3721e3abcf\">Minimalism and deprivation</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Nor is it second since I’ve never established the first one. It’s more of an observation that I had recently regarding minimalist living and why it works.</p><p>Now, you’re probably vaguely familiar or remember the idea of the second law of thermodynamics. To summarize it in a non-sciencey way, it’s essentially the idea that things tend towards disorder unless outside energy is applied. A good example of this is taking a bath. Initially, it is all nice and hot but after a while you realize the water has cooled down because the heat has escaped.</p><p>So what does that have to do with minimalism? I think you can draw a neat parallel between thermodynamics and ownership of things (or obligations). It’s also a great way to better understand two things</p><ol><li>Why are you unhappy with everything you have</li><li>How can having less possibly make you happier</li></ol><p>Let’s imagine yourself owning a very basic set of dishes. You have nothing beyond a single plate, knife, fork and spoon. Also, washing dishes isn’t exactly your favourite activity. Life is pretty tough. What can we do to improve it?</p><p>One thing we can do is add a cup. Now you’re able to enjoy water comfortably instead of trying to collect it in your hands. Sounds pretty great no? Your happiness should improve dramatically. I have no doubt that drinking water without a cup is adding a lot of unnecessary inefficiency to your life. This is also the overall thought process that people go through when determining if they need to purchase something or not.</p><p>But there’s one thing we’ve overlooked. We forgot to account for the cost of maintenance for this item. I use maintenance as a general form to refer to actions like storing the item, washing the item and finding the item. All trivial indeed but don’t forget, all we have is one set of everything. In this case, the trivial maintenance cost is just that. Trivial.</p><p>Maintenance becomes a problem as the number of items that you own increases. Each of them providing a diminishing return for your convenience but increases the maintenance somewhat linearly. For example, getting another cup would mean another person can have a drink with me but all the above maintenance costs just doubled.</p><p>This maintenance cost comes to us in two primary forms. The first is at the cost of our time. We have to spend time washing the cup and putting it away. But also, it comes in the form of mental clutter. This will arise when you don’t take care of the maintenance tasks immediately and they start pilling up.</p><p>You can extrapolate this further to all the items that you own. And you own A LOT. Like thousands a lot. Each may take 1–10 seconds in maintenance on average so together it takes a significant chunk of your day. And before you realize it, you spend a significant portion of your free time just putting things back together, finishing up unfinished projects and just basic cleaning. No wonder you don’t have any time.</p><p>The second law of minimalism is this:</p><blockquote>Everything has it’s cost. Make sure you understand it well</blockquote><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c487f90a8ff3\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/second-law-of-minimalism-c487f90a8ff3\">Second law of minimalism</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I find the idea very attractive. And it seems <a href=\"https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp01-mobile-phone/\">I’m not the only one either</a>. It will ensure that my phone usage decreases dramatically while still giving me a way out in case I’m in trouble or if someone is looking to reach me.</p><p>The problem is that dumb phones are missing certain key apps that I rely on heavily. For example, I like having Google maps for orientation. I mentioned this idea to my wife and to my surprise she questioned my basic assumptions. She asked me when was the last time I was suddenly lost. Could I not look up my path prior to going there and print out the directions? You know, like we used to do.</p><p>That’s a valid point. I think I like the idea of having maps a lot more then I actually need them. I’m certain there’s very few instances that I suddenly needed them because of some unforeseen circumstances. So what’s really holding me back?</p><p>Another thing I could think of was various messengers I use to communicate with my friends around the country. That one is a little tougher since everyone have their messenger of choice and platform fragmentation isn’t helping the situation. At any one time I have 3 messengers running to talk to different groups of people. I’m not trying to claim it’s unsolvable problem but it’s definitely inconvenient.</p><p>In her eternal brilliance, my wife asked me, what was actually bothering on my smartphone? In other words, what was I spending most of my time on? I admitted that it was email. I like to check it far more often then I should.

Another thing that I try to avoid when I’m <strong>not</strong> around people is to stick my face in my smartphone.

Holding ESPPs is worse than I thought</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mejRoXmaep3EVw8O68BG9g.jpeg\" /></figure><p>This doesn’t happen very often.</p><p>I was corrected — on Twitter of all places. Turns out, my advice to you about selling ESPPs was spot on but my reasoning was wrong. I am here humbled in front of you and I stand corrected. Thank you <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/db5708d4ae24\">Tom Larson</a> for setting me straight.</p><p>Tax treatment for ESPPs is more complicated than I initially thought. My whole argument was <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-non-boring-advise-about-your-employee-stock-purchase-plan-3aa34f187cfb\">centered around the idea</a> that keeping the ESPP shares to pay long term capital gains tax was misguided because the savings are minuscule. The math is certainly impeccable. The tax treatment on the other hand is wrong.</p><p>Turns out, any discount given to you by your employer, is always taxed as regular income — regardless of how long you kept it for. That’s a bummer for Aaron.</p><p>It gets even nastier. My buddy Bob pointed another provision in the tax code. But first, a few definitions:</p><ol><li><strong>Offering period</strong>: the period of time the participant is locked in to a particular stock purchase plan; typically this is 12 months.</li><li><strong>Purchase period</strong>: the frequency in which you purchase stock within your <strong>offering period</strong>; typically this is 6 months (meaning there’s two purchase periods in a typical offering period).</li></ol><p>Great, now that we’re up to speed, let’s pretend your company stock doubled between the beginning of the offering period and the purchase date 6 months later. Here’s the kicker: to get a long term capital gains rate on the <strong>gain</strong> beyond the company discount, you must meet two criteria.</p><ol><li>Hold the shares for 12 months from the purchase date AND</li><li>Hold the shares for 24 months from the beginning of the offering period.</li></ol><p>That means, half the time you must hold your company stock for a full 18 months before you get to enjoy the lower tax rate.</p><p>To summarize for the skimmers: any discount given to you by the employer is <strong>always </strong>taxed as regular income. Any gain beyond that may be taxed as long term capital gains but the shares must be held for 24 months after offering period starts.</p><p>If the stock price went down between the offering date and the purchase date, the decisions becomes a complete no-brainer. Sell immediately. There is no advantages to be gained.</p><p>If the stock is up and you’re thinking of holding on to save a couple of bucks, consider these:</p><ol><li>Would you buy the stock today at the current price?</li><li>Are you willing to hold on for up to 18 months to save around 10% of your gains?</li></ol><p>If it’s a resounding yes to both questions, go ahead and wait.

One of them is called an ESPP or employee stock purchase plan. It is a scheme by which the employer incentivizes you to purchase its stock using a portion of your salary. The incentive is usually some sort of a discount or top up.</p><p>One question that frequently comes up is what to do once the shares are vested into your account.</p><p>You can go down one of two roads. First, you can sell all the shares immediately and purchase something else. Spoiler alert, I’m in this camp.</p><p>Second, you can keep the shares.</p><p>The reasoning for keeping the shares is actually quite solid. If you’ve made money on the stock market and you’ve held the shares for less than a year, you are subject to good old fashion <strong>income</strong> tax. If, on the other hand, you held it for more than a year, you are subject to shiny new <strong>capital gains</strong> tax; and you guessed it, the shiny new capital gains taxes are usually lower.</p><p>This is exactly the argument I was having with my friend Aaron at work yesterday. Our shares from ESPP are set to vest in November and he was inquiring about my plans for the money. I told him I was going to sell everything and purchase a boring and dull index fund. He told me I was crazy for throwing my money away.</p><p>This discussion went on for longer then I am ready to admit but I thought I can summarize the lessons here. Also, since this is my blog, my opinion is right.</p><p>Let’s start with an example: Since Aaron is a well paid executive of a small company, his household income is $300,000. That puts Aaron at the 24% tax bracket. Aaron’s company offers a 15% discount on the share price. Finally, Aaron commits $20,000 to the ESPP plan.</p><p>First, it’s important to note that only your gains are taxed — not your entire investment. In this case, if you were to sell the shares immediately after vesting, your discount would be your only gain. In other words, 15% of $20,000 or $3000.</p><p>Second, uncle Sam would come calling for his portion of those $3000 at the end of the year. His share would be 24% of $3000 or $720 — that’s what you owe the government.</p><p>Third, if you were to keep the shares for a year, you are still not scot-free. The capital gains tax is still 15% of $3000 or $450.</p><p>By holding on to the shares for an entire year, you’ve saved yourself less than $270 ($720 minus $450) or roughly 1% of the entire sum. To put that into perspective, my company’s stock went down 4% yesterday (and up 17% today).</p><p>I don’t know about you but that does not seem like a good deal to me. Putting money in a single company is notoriously volatile. Doing it with the company you work for is a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1008712386485424000\">potential disaster</a>.</p><p>Of course, this is a somewhat contrived example. There are many other things to take into account</p><ol><li>If you’re filing individually and earning above $200,000, the <strong>gap </strong>between the income tax and capital gains tax is 20% instead of 9%. If you’re earning $38,000, the gap is actually negative (the income tax is lower). You can find the latest rates <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/\">here</a>.</li><li>If you contribute significantly more than $20,000 into the ESPP program your tax loss might be greater. Of course, that also means you must keep more money in a single stock.</li><li>If the incentive from your employer is larger, your tax could be greater. For example, when purchasing ESPP shares, my employer uses either the price today or the one from 6 months ago — whichever one is lower. As of this writing, the stock is up 10% from 6 months ago. My taxable gain is now higher.</li></ol><p>It is worth evaluating your exact situation to determine how much money you are actually saving.</p><p>Also, I don’t want to imply that saving a couple of hundred bucks isn’t worth the time — it certainly is. I will gladly give my insurance company a call if it saves me money. That lizard has been good to me.</p><p>However, these savings don’t come for free. You are leaving a significant amount of money in a stock that you may or may not want to own.</p><p>Therefore; my advice to you is this. Sell the damn shares. Put them in <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager\">betterment</a>. You can thank me later.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3aa34f187cfb\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-non-boring-advise-about-your-employee-stock-purchase-plan-3aa34f187cfb\">A non boring advice about your employee stock purchase plan</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I could plug in a few numbers into an online calculator and get a rough idea of when I could “retire”. After all, the principal is very simple. Mark your expenses on a graph. It should be a horizontal line with a slight upward slope to account for inflation. Plot your expected passive income each year. It should be a line with a steeper upward slope. Once those two lines intersect, congratulations, you are financially independent.</p><p>Figuring out your expenses is simple. Take your income. Subtract your savings. Whatever is left is your expenses.</p><p>How about your passive income? That’s easy as well. Take your net worth — all money you have invested. Apply the 4% rule (I have yet to write about it. You can Google it for now. In short, you can consider 4% of your net worth as passive income for the year). Done.</p><p>That’s all fine and dandy while you are living in your mom’s basement like I did. At some point though, you are likely to get your own place that comes with a mortgage and its own set of responsibilities. That’s when things get tricky. The fundamental idea doesn’t change. You still need to wait for the expenses curve to intersect with the passive income curve. The complexity is identifying those expenses.</p><p>While building <a href=\"https://effai.me\">Effai.me</a> I had to think long and hard about it because I just bought my own house. I was trying to see what kind of an effect it would have on my Effai date. After combing through the interwebs and researching through the available literature, the answer was… it depends. It depends on what you want to do. Turns out, you have three choices.</p><p><strong>Sell your house. </strong>Assuming the price of the house increases over time, you may find yourself at a point where selling your house could net you a big pile of money. That could significantly shorten your time to Effai. Once you sell it, the passive income you could generate would skyrocket.</p><p>How would you know if this is a good option for you? It’s a little more involved. You have to know several things.</p><ol><li>Your mortgage payments</li><li>Your home maintenance cost</li><li>Your property tax</li></ol><p>The sum of the three above is your <strong>housing cost</strong>. In addition, you’d need to know your new <strong>rental costs</strong>. That’s just one more number.</p><ol><li>The cost to rent something equivalent.</li></ol><p>When you sell, you bring your <strong>housing cost</strong> down to zero but introduce a new expense — <strong>rental costs</strong>. The two expenses are likely in the same ballpark and mostly cancel each other out. Selling your house and renting is usually your fastest way to Effai.</p><p>Of course, most people wouldn’t dream of ever going back to renting. After all, they’ve “left college years ago”. In that case, you are left with two other options.</p><p><strong>Pay off your mortgage. </strong>In a way, this is a mirror image of selling your house. Instead of putting money to work for you, you decide to reduce your expenses. This strategy will eliminate your monthly mortgage payment (Yay!!). However, you are still left with the maintenance bill and the always increasing property tax (Boo).</p><p>This could be a great strategy if you don’t have much debt left on your mortgage. A simple rule of thumb is this:</p><blockquote>If the mortgage payoff amount cannot generate more passive income than your monthly mortgage payments, go ahead and pay off your mortgage.</blockquote><p><strong>Don’t (or never) pay off your mortgage. </strong>You probably saw this one coming. If the rule above does not hold, this is for you. You are likely to find yourself in this situation if you bought the house recently and you still have a large amount of debt left. In that case, it may be cheaper for you to just keep your expenses as they are — mortgage payments included — and have your money passively pay for those expenses. This is a temporary solution since at some point you’ll have so little debt left you may want to pay it off. However, in the interest of retiring as early as possible this is definitely a possibility.</p><p>You’ll be glad to know that <a href=\"https://effai.me\">Effai.me</a> runs all three of these scenarios for you. It is very biased towards retiring early. I hope the above made sense. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need some clarifications.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6b5f4ab853e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/will-purchasing-a-home-help-or-hurt-financial-independence-6b5f4ab853e\">Will purchasing a home help or hurt financial independence?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It is honestly one of my favorite past time activities. On the surface, it is a very simple concept. Save a bunch of money. Keep going until you supplement your living expenses. Conversation over, right? Wrong. Turns out, there’s a lot more to it.</p><p>I ended up having an interesting discussion recently with my colleagues Troy and Nina over beer (all good conversations involve beer). The question we deliberated was this:</p><blockquote>Why do we leave retirement to the end?</blockquote><p>If you’re in the traditional mindset of retiring at 65, this might seem like an odd question. How else would you have it? On the other hand, If you’ve discovered the wonderful world of financial independence, it’s a perfectly fair question. Why do we leave it to the end?</p><p>The end can certainly be very long. You can stay retired for 60 years. But it still comes after continuous chunk of work.</p><p>So what’s the alternative? One option is to take 6 months off right now. Do your thing. Then come back and work some more.</p><p>This actually has a great benefit. You get to discover what it’s like to be financially independent without having to wait for years for your savings to accumulate. It’s like shopping at Costco without membership. Fantastic!</p><p>The first time I heard about this concept was back around 2011 when I read <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/56d3bc91794f\">Tim Ferriss</a>’s 4 hour work week. In the book he talks about having mini retirements throughout your working life. I thought the idea was profound. It definitely changed the way I viewed retirement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531103480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+work+week\">The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich</a></p><p>Except there’s a problem. Lunches aren’t free. In this case, it’s your <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">TTF</a> (Time To Financial independence). If you are taking time off work to travel and “find yourself”, you’re not earning any money. If you’re doing it for 6 months, you just set yourself back by 6 months.</p><p>It gets worse. Since you are unable to perform photosynthesis, you also end up spending money. Your TTF moves back by an additional number of months it would take you to save what you’ve just spent. It can be summarized as follows:</p><blockquote>Your TTF moves forward by the amount you save and moves back by the amount you earn.</blockquote><p>You save less than 100% of what you earn. Hence, it will take you longer to make up the hole in your savings than the time you took off.</p><p>There’s a second downside to the concept of mini-retirements. People seeking financial independence (effai seekers) tend to fall in one of two (or both) camps.</p><ul><li>You are looking for <strong>freedom </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the work schedules.</li><li>You are looking for <strong>security </strong>— expressed as autonomy from the business cycle.</li></ul><p>Mini-retirements address the freedom part at the expense of security part.</p><p>Imagine you’re a technology worker in 1999. You decide you’re burned out. You’d like to take 6 months off and travel to Thailand. Great! except when you come back, there’s no job waiting for you. It’s likely you won’t have another one for a while. Once you do get one, it’s going to be half the salary.</p><p>None of this means you can’t be financially independent but recessions and economic downturns are things most people want to avoid. One such way is financial independence.</p><p>Does this mean my professional opinion is that mini-retirements are a bad idea? Absolutely not.</p><p>You could mitigate the downsides by taking less time off. 3 months might suffice to find who you really are. The damage to your TTF is eased and your employer might even agree to keep your position open for you. Just be aware of the risks. I have been always too scared to take the time off.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aa52c4c59f8b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-do-we-leave-retirement-to-the-end-aa52c4c59f8b\">Why do we leave retirement to the end?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Of course there is. In one scenario you get to drive a brand new SUV to work with shiny new rims and an obnoxiously loud exhaust pipe, and the other you’re po’. I don’t think I need to explain which one is which. No one would dispute this.</p><p>However 😃, there is one important assumption we made. The assumption is that being po’ (that’s short for “poor” if someone is unclear) is bad and driving an SUV is good. In other words, we are talking about a basic, familiar consumer lifestyle. That is probably a fine assumption. Nonetheless, what if you’re an effai seeker? Apparently it’s <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5241566/vicki-robin-financial-independence-retire-early/\">all the rage with millennials</a>. You’d have to reconsider those assumptions.</p><p>The reason for this is very simple. If you are seeking effai, your goal isn’t to burn through as many resources as possible during your lifetime. Your goal is to get a <em>minimum amount of resources you need — and as early as possible</em>. That’s quite a different form of consumption.</p><p>So what gets you there sooner? By being “poor” you end up spending less money.</p><p>Spending less money means you require less money to live on.</p><p>Requiring less money to live on means you can save it up faster. That’s pretty simple math.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now return to the original question: Is a penny saved, as good as a penny earned? The answer to that is absolutely not. It’s far better.</p><p>Let’s take Hank and Lenny as an example (I have debated this with my friend Hank many times although I am somewhat misrepresenting his stance). For convenience, let’s also assume they have roughly the same standard of living costing $60k annually (or $5k monthly). They also save the same $3k per month. At that rate, and with some reasonable assumptions, it would take them about 16 years to reach effai (you can check for yourself <a href=\"https://effai.me/\">here</a>). If they started at 20 and keeping life circumstances constant, they’d reach effai at 36.</p><p>Turns out though, that Hank is also a very hard worker and got promoted recently. He also got a nice pay bump to go along with a fancier title and is now able to save an <strong>extra</strong> $1k a month. In other words, he is socking away $4k monthly instead of $3k. That brings his <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>T</strong>o e<strong>F</strong>fai (TTF 😃) down to 13.7 years from 16 — a savings of 2.3 years. Not bad!</p><p>Lenny on the other hand is a cheapskate. Instead of making more money, Lenny decided to cut his expenses by $1k (Let’s ignore the how for the sake of this article). What does that mean for Lenny? Since Lenny cut his expenses, he now lives on $4k a month instead of $5k. That puts effai 13 years away. That’s an additional 0.7 years sooner than Hank.</p><p><strong>Additionally</strong>, since Lenny cut his expenses, by $1k without changing anything else, he just freed up $1k to put towards <strong>savings</strong>. Lenny is now able to also save $4k per month just like Hank. This makes effai only 11 years away — a full 5 years earlier then originally anticipated.</p><p>In short, each penny you save, from an effai view, actually has two roles. First, it’s a penny you don’t have to produce with your passive income anymore. Second, it’s a penny you can redirect towards savings — Increasing significantly your savings rate.</p><blockquote>So, no, a penny saved is not a penny earned, it’s two!</blockquote><p>There is actually one other way to look at all of this. I find this to be far more impressive to think about than 11 years versus 13.7 years. Consider instead how much less money you actually need. For example, let’s go back to Lenny. He went from spending $5k to $4k and increased his savings from $3k to $4k.</p><p>Now take the 4% rule. Oh? You’re not familiar with it? I realize that I haven’t written about it yet. I’ll summarize it super quickly for the sake of this article:</p><blockquote>You can passively earn a dollar a month forever by intelligently investing $300.</blockquote><p>Now take the 4% rule. By cutting $1k a month from what Lenny spends, Lenny does not need to intelligently invest $300k. In other words, Lenny just saved himself from saving $300k.</p><p>This gets a tiny bit better actually. You should never think of your retirement number in today’s dollars. You always have to take inflation into account. The $300k we just saved for Lenny is in today’s dollars. Since Lenny is retiring in 11 years — and with an inflation rate of 2%, Lenny shaved off a whopping $373k off his retirement number. Cha-ching.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=32a31bf45d8a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">A penny saved is a penny earned.

We talked about all the different programs Uncle Sam offers to reduce our tax bill at the end of the year. There’s the traditional ones we hear about all the time like 401k’s and IRA. There’s a mention of a few less common ones as well. I encourage you to read it if you haven’t yet.</p><p>However, one of the most controversial options I mentioned was the Health Savings Account — also known as the HSA. Turns out, some people are not aware of all the super powers of the HSA and in turn ended up paying unnecessary taxes to the government. Thus; I’ve decided to break it down for you in a digestible way.</p><p>First, let’s talk about what HSA is used for. HSA is a savings account (I bet you didn’t see that coming) that allows you to save money for <strong>medical purposes</strong>. Each dollar that you set aside in an HSA is <strong>tax free. </strong>The money in the account can be invested in the stock market and grow tax free. Once you have a medical expense, the money can be withdrawn from the account, once again, tax free. You get the idea. One caveat is that HSA is only available for <strong>high deductible health plans.</strong></p><p>Of course, the government cannot allow you to put every single penny you earn towards medical expenses. There is a limit of $3,450 per person or $6,900 for a couple per year. That’s 2018 numbers.</p><p>Here’s a quick example of how it would work. Assume your household income for 2018 is $100,000. If you were to max out your HSA for you and your spouse, the government would tax you on $93,100 instead of the entire $100,000. That’s a free, ~$1500 you don’t have to pay in taxes!</p><p>Aside from federal income tax, there’s a few other taxes snuck into your pay stub. Two of them are social security and medicare — affectionately known as FICA. Together they add up to 7.65% of your income. Turns out, <strong>unlike</strong> <strong>all </strong>other retirement accounts available to you, HSA is the only one that is exempt from paying FICA taxes too. That’s another ~$500 in your deep pockets.</p><p>That’s just the beginning though. Once you’ve set aside the money in your HSA, the most powerful force in the universe takes over — compound interest. That’s because each dollar you’ve set aside can be invested and grow tax free. Naturally, as a FI (financial independence) pursuer, you’d invest it in a diversified index fund of stocks*. Over time, the growth alone could dominate any further contributions.</p><p>Let’s also address the elephant in the room. What do you do if you don’t need to spend all this money on health care? What if you’re healthy? Once again, you’re in luck. Aside from being healthy, once you hit 65, all the money saved up in your HSA can be used for <strong>anything </strong>penalty free. You heard that right; <strong>anything. </strong>Taxation is also simple. It is treated like regular income. In essence, your HSA becomes a traditional IRA. One exception is if HSA is used for medical purposes. In that case, withdrawals are still tax free.</p><p>This beast of Roth and Traditional IRA blended and fused together sounds like a great deal, doesn’t it? Should you then go ahead and switch your health plan at work to a high deductible plan as soon as possible? Probably.</p><p>However, there is one notable exception. If you tend to have high medical bills throughout the year, it doesn’t make much sense to switch to a higher deductible health plan. You could be better off forgoing the tax savings and letting the employer subsidize your health costs instead.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that some generous employers contribute to your HSA as well. It does count against your overall limit but free money is free money.</p><p>Finally, there’s always going to be a subset of people who are terrified of exposing themselves to a little bit more risk through the high deductible health plan. I suggest that you read my article addressing insurance in general appropriately named “<a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">what to insure</a>”. To summarize it in one sentence, I’d say, don’t worry about it if you can afford it.</p><p>*I need to write something an article, or more likely a series about stock investing for the FI pursuer.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ebdd3f35be8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/hsa-a-friend-on-the-road-to-financial-freedom-ebdd3f35be8\">HSA: a friend on the road to financial freedom</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I dread it because it’s that special time of the year. It’s the time you have to gather all those illegible slips you received from your employer and enter them in to some half baked software online. As you go through the process, the dollar amount you owe/receive will swing wildly making you break into a sweaty mess. All of this is coupled with a stack of indecipherable rules handed down to you from some government entity responsible for the tax collection.</p><p>The entire mess with all the pre-tax and post-tax deductions, itemization, credits, and exemptions makes it incomprehensible if all you want to do is “pay your fair share”. Additionally, once a tax break is given, it’s very hard to take it back. Thus; we end up with 80,000 pages of IRS lawyer talk.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if at least you could take advantage of all these rules?</p><p>That’s why, I’m going to explore here the following question: <em>What is the maximum amount you can earn without paying any federal tax?</em></p><p>To keep this manageable, I will make a few assumptions. First, you’re filing as a married couple. This is purely out of convenience for me since that’s how I file. If you are filing as a single person, most of the time you can just divide the number in half. Additionally, there is a pile of rules I’ll ignore for convenience. They either don’t apply to the vast majority of people or are insignificant for the bottom line. Also, I will ignore Medicaid and Social security taxes. Finally, I will ignore any possible employer contributions or matches into your retirement accounts.</p><p>Let’s start by defining a few terms.</p><p><strong>Pre-tax </strong>(or traditional) — A type of deduction for which you don’t have to pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>Post-tax</strong> (or roth) — A type of deduction for which you do pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>401(k) — </strong>A retirement plan sponsored by your employer</p><p><strong>IRA — </strong>A retirement plan that you pay for yourself.</p><p><strong>Standard deduction — </strong>An amount every tax filer gets to deduct from their income to find their taxable income.</p><p><strong>Capital gains — </strong>The tax applied on an investment</p><p><em>Everything beyond will assume a pre-tax or traditional deduction. Roth deductions are for suckers. We will explore that next.</em></p><p>Now that we got the jargon out of the way, let’s see how we can apply it. We can start with the easiest. The standard deduction. It is $24,000 for a couple for the year 2018. If your family unit is bringing <strong><em>$24,000</em></strong> per year, the standard deduction would bring your taxable income down to $0. In turn, your taxes would be $0. Fantastic.</p><p>Next, you can contribute to a traditional IRA. The limits for traditional IRAs is $5500 per person or $11,000 per couple. Remember that a traditional IRA is a pre-tax deduction. Thus; you can earn an additional $11,000 per couple and pay $0 tax. We are now up to <strong><em>$35,000</em></strong>.</p><p>Similarly to IRA, you can also contribute to a traditional 401(k) program with your employer (if the employer is offering it). Each person has an IRS mandated limit of $18,500. Since you’re filing as a couple that gives you a total of $37,000 to deduct. Adding it to the above gives us a total of <strong><em>$72,000</em></strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>There’s one more easy pre-tax deduction left. The health savings account (HSA). This is a great choice for individuals with low medical expenses. Some highly respectable online individuals even describe it as the <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/\">ultimate savings account</a>. For 2018, the limit for a couple is $6,900. Adding that in to our total gives us <strong>$78,900</strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>In many cases, 401(k)’s and HSA’s come with a few more advantages. First, many employers are willing to match at least a part of your contributions. That usually amounts to a few thousand tax free dollars. Additionally, if you are 50 or older, 401(k)’s allow you to sock away another $6000 per individual. That’s another potential $12,000 to put away depending on your age.</p><p>Alright, we got all the obvious things out of the way. If you are not maximizing these, what are you waiting for?</p><p>Now let’s talk about the more esoteric options. First, there’s the 457(b). That’s a special program for government workers. If you are a teacher or a nurse or some other government worker you can usually participate in this plan. 457(b) plan has an interesting feature. Unlike other employer sponsored retirement plans, this option has a separate limit. That means you can contribute to both 401(k) and 457(b). Both also have the same limits. Therefore; if a couple works for the government, that’s an additional $37,000 that can be deducted. That would give you <strong>$115,900</strong> tax free dollars if my math is correct.</p><p>Of course this is not the Soviet Union. We don’t all work for the government. However, there is one other interesting way to reduce your taxes. If you went through my list of terms above, you may remember “capital gains”; the tax applied on investments. The great thing about this tax is that under certain conditions, when your investment “qualifies”, this tax can be 0 percent. You heard that right. You’ll pay nothing. The requirements are also relatively moderate. The main requirement is that your investment must be held for at least a year.</p><p>Once your investment is “qualified”, as long as you manage to keep your total <strong>taxable</strong> income to under $77,200, you’ll actually owe nothing to the government. Taxable is bolded on purpose. Remember that through the power of IRA’s, 401(k)’s and HSA’s we were able to earn $78,900 tax free. That’s because, for the purpose of taxation, you’ve earned $0. Now, if you were to earn an additional $77,200 from capital gains, that would still be taxed at 0 percent due to capital gains taxes. Amazing!</p><p>So what’s the bottom line?</p><p>As a couple with a decent job, you can earn <strong>$78,900</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the state or federal government, you can earn <strong>$115,900 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn an astonishing <strong>$193,100</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple above 50, working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn <strong>$205,100 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>There’s a huge array of further deductions and credits you can look into to reduce your taxes further. If you prefer, you can think of it as increasing your taxable income while keeping your tax obligation at zero. For example, the child tax credit can give you up to $2000.</p><p>However, most of us are not working for the government and do not have a portfolio that can generate $80,000 in capital gains year after year. Yet we can still reduce are taxable income by almost $79,000. To put that in perspective, the median income of a <strong><em>married</em></strong> household in 2016 was roughly $87,000; a little more then you can deduct.</p><p>I’m a strong proponent of saving hard and saving fast. That’s why, I encourage everyone to participate in any government money give away that is available to them within the legal boundaries. Retirement savings programs are “use it or lose” it programs. Make sure you use it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=737acc94778f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/most-money-you-can-earn-without-paying-a-dime-in-tax-737acc94778f\">Most money you can earn without paying a dime in tax</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I promised them a blog post was coming and <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/make-it-rain-with-bitcoin-clickbait-218a528a85b1\">delivered it</a>. Since then, I’ve done some more reading about the concept and would like to clarify a few stances.</p><p>Before I do any clarification, I just want to say that I think the idea is actually very interesting. It is modeled after gold and assumes certain positions on the economy and prosperity. The libertarian in me definitely likes where this is going.</p><p>One error that I made when reading about Bitcoin was the assumption that all transactions are completely anonymous. I was under the impression that you can transfer money between two consenting adults and the government cannot politely place their noses in your business and ask for a cut. However, that’s not the case.</p><p>Either way, the idea of modeling it like gold is very intriguing. Every so often, when a conversation turns to money, someone looking to sound smart will state some sort of an opinion about how today’s money is “fiat currency” backed by nothing but thin air and promises. In the good old days, we had the gold standard so each dollar was worth something.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgKkfhi8Eaiw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgKkfhi8Eaiw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href\">https://medium.com/media/c41f9bb1037976e860cc09fcaa10cdb7/href</a></iframe><p>As the video above points out around the 50 second mark, the gold standard does not mean that money is backed by anything either. Gold is just a convenient way of figuring out who owns what and who owes who. It is like a ledger where we write down all the transactions.</p><blockquote>Gold isn’t valuable because we make jewellery out of it. It’s the other way around.</blockquote><p>As it turns out, good forms of money (such as gold) have 5 properties.</p><ol><li><strong>Scarcity — </strong>Gold is pretty hard to find</li><li><strong>Fungiability —</strong> Any gram of gold is equally valuable</li><li><strong>Divisibility —</strong> You can subdivide gold into smaller pieces to pay for cheaper things.</li><li><strong>Durability — </strong>Gold is a noble metal. Does not react under most extreme weather conditions.</li><li><strong>Transferability — </strong>Exchanging gold coins is reasonably easy and been done for thousands of years.</li></ol><p>Bitcoin meets all of the criteria above and some would argue exceeds these criteria relatively to gold. Does it mean it’s time to remortgage your house and go all in on Bitcoin mining like your Uber driver told you? Not quite. There’s 4 big problems that I see with the current state of crypto-currencies.</p><p><strong>It’s not an investment. </strong>The view that Bitcoin is an investment seems to be the most dangerous to me although it’s a widely held belief. To be fair, it’s hard to argue with results. If you held Bitcoin from 2010 to today you’d be a Zillionaire. Naturally, the typical precautions apply. “Past performance do not guarantee future results”.</p><p>However, I’m mostly referring to the word “investment”. I don’t think it should be used in this case. The reason is that an investment implies some sort of return due to added value. For example, you invest in stocks because you get to own a company that presumably adds value over time. Added value leads to bigger profits. Bigger profits lead to dividends and as a share holder you have a claim on those dividends. Similarly, we invest in real estate because we count on the rental income. We provide the valuable service of shelter and to thank us, the renter hands us dollars.</p><p>Where is the value being added when you store your dollars in the form of Bitcoin? There’s none actually. It’s just a commodity like gold. You may argue that it’s a store of value. You can make an argument that it’s a hedge against inflation (assuming it ever stabilizes in price). But there’s definitely no added value there so it’s not an investment.</p><p>And it isn’t just semantics. Something that is not an investment but you still risk money on to make more money sounds a lot like a gamble. I think that if everyone treated it like a gamble, the results wouldn’t be nearly as exciting. The pundits on TV would have to quiet down and the small talk at dinner will have to shift back to real estate (because that’s what we did before Bitcoin).</p><p><strong>Investors have no clue how it works. </strong>We were having a social gathering the other day. Once we were done talking about Trump for the night, the conversation obviously shifted to Bitcoin. Two of my friends wanted to know what I thought of the idea and if they should invest in it. We started talking about some fundamentals of money and investing when it dawned on me; I was standing next to two world class software engineers neither of whom understood how crypto-currencies worked. Neither did I. However, they were ready to put down thousands of dollars into this “investment”.</p><p>A week later I am chatting with another friend over coffee when he pulls out his phone to show me his portfolio. He has huge gains. Over 80% in just a month. Turns out he invested in 20 different crypto-currencies. However, when I asked him what percentage of the tech he understood, he admitted that it was roughly 0.5%. I appreciate the honesty but worried of the implications.</p><p>To be fair, this is anecdotal but I have a feeling it’s much more wide spread than many realize. Personally, I would never dream of investing in a company without ever knowing at least what they do and looking at some financial ratios. However, in this case, at least in some limited examples, it seems like the default approach is to buy now and figure it out later.</p><p><strong>It’s actually not that useful.</strong> This reason is most up for debate but I think it’s also going to be the most influential. For a currency to be of any use, it must be widely accepted. Bitcoin isn’t quite there yet. Some would argue that it’s just a matter of time until it’s adopted. However, I’m wondering why? Why would anyone actually use it?</p><p>I see one use case for me. I would like to be able to transfer money internationally without paying a middle man. Some people may like to buy guns and blow on the black market. Outside of that, I’m not really sure why it would be adopted. It makes moving money marginally better but adds a lot of barriers that need to be overcome.</p><p>What I’m really saying, is that beyond the hyper paranoid consumer and the mafia Don, there’s very little added value to Bitcoin as a currency. Therefore; I must wonder why it would gain any traction as a currency versus more established ones like the USD. I’m thinking about your average consumer. The ones that make up 95% of the population.</p><p><strong>It can easily be competed out of business. </strong>So there’s Bitcoin. There’s also Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Three weeks ago, I introduced SuckerCoin. In fact, as of this writing, there’s <strong>thousands</strong> of different crypto-currencies you can trade. Crypto-currencies are built on public ideas and open source technologies. There’s very little competitive advantage any one currency has that another cannot just adopt.</p><p>Bitcoin does have the advantage that is the first and best known. However, that could easily be erased over time as others gain (or Bitcoin loses). One option companies use to maintain their competitive advantage is to lobby the government for regulations and licensing to keep competitors out. I have a hard time imagining the Bitcoin lobby passing that through congress though.</p><p>The result is that anyone can start their own crypto-currency. Some of them have even real advantages. For example, Bitcoin has a limitation on how many transactions it can process in a 10 minute block. That is addressed in other currencies. Some currencies don’t even bother with that. They just jump on the hype train. After all, a rising tied lifts all boats.</p><p>If Bitcoin, or any other crypto-currency has any chance of staying around for the long term, it must be the currency that is accepted everywhere. But with thousands of currencies, how would anyone make the right choice? Of course, you could imagine a world where everyone accepts all crypto-currencies. However, in that case, the whole scarcity idea (property #1) becomes … questionable.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think that Bitcoin is a really cool idea. Getting central planning out of our money supply is a goal worth pursuing. Bitcoin should be thought of as version 1.0 of that idea. But just like all good software, we need to keep iterating over it.</p><p>Block-chain (the general idea behind all crypto-currencies) is great. I’m sure it will be widely adopted. Maybe even for our own financial system. Maybe by our governments. Who knows? However, I’m going to stick to the tried and true. I’m keeping my money in a well diversified passively managed index fund and I recommend you do the same. More on that later.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ds2XHyzPA9Zc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fs2XHyzPA9Zc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href\">https://medium.com/media/83a65befa6a321a50d99171266b9afdc/href</a></iframe><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=375f566905b8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/elaborating-more-on-bitcoin-value-375f566905b8\">Elaborating more on Bitcoin value</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I also have a sample size of 2 when it comes to this fallacy, yet I am convinced that it is applicable to about 95% of you and I am going to attempt to convince you of this truth as well.</p><p>Let’s first start with what Costco is all about for those that are not familiar. Costco is a giant retail store where you can buy things in bulk. The idea is that by pre paying for items, you can save in the long run. For that privilege you get to pay an annual membership of $60 or so.</p><p>Now here’s what I’m claiming. You are just fooling yourself into thinking that this is a great deal. We are really great at fooling ourselves. We will justify almost anything that we do as the right rational thing. Their marketing is top notch and they create an illusion of savings when in reality you are wasting more money then ever before. Wow, those are serious claims!</p><p>So why am I saying this? Well, the truth is that it all comes down to one thing. Over-consumption. Simple as that. Now, before you dismiss this as it does not apply to you, let me elaborate on the four distinct ways over-consumption manifests itself and see how many of them ring true.</p><ol><li>Subconscious over consumption. This is the hardest one to identify. It’s the one where you buy a huge box of razors but then switch out your razors just a few shaves sooner. It isn’t on purpose but it’s totally natural. After all, we value scarcity. Shopping in bulk is the exact opposite. If you swear that you get exactly the same number of shaves from the blades then how about paper towels? You probably grab just a few more because you got a ton more in the cupboard. I’m not going to count how you use them but you get the idea.</li><li>Product upgrades. A lot of people tend to over consume through product upgrades. Costco, in all honesty, does tend to be cheaper for some products. However, very frequently, they don’t have your exact brand or product. They could have similar or competing products. For example, take detergent. I use the powder. It’s cheap and works reasonably well. However, my brand of choice also has these little pillows that you just throw in to the wash. If the labour of measuring the powder is too much for your liking, the pillows are a great substitute. Naturally, they are the more premium product and for that convenience and premium feel, you have to pay up. Costco chooses to sell the premium product. The price per wash turns out to be roughly the same as if you went to your local grocery store and bought the powder. So by shopping at Costco you get to use the more premium product for the <strong>same price</strong>. When it comes time to account for all the savings though, the mind will play it out differently. Now we will compare the price of the <strong>same detergent</strong> in Costco to our grocery store. In that case, Costco definitely comes out on top. What we didn’t realize though is how we attributed savings to Costco that don’t really exist while inflating our lifestyle that didn’t really need inflating.</li><li>Next, there’s a more obvious way that we over consume. It is plain and simple waste. I’m thinking about all the times you bought that big tub of salsa that went bad or the big box of spinach that didn’t make it. I’m sure we’re all guilty of that. You were trying to do the right thing but depending on the number of units in your family, it could just be impractical.</li><li>There’s one other way that Costco gets you. In my opinion this is the biggest sink of money. It is also somewhat controversial because people will swear they don’t do it and it’s hard to prove otherwise. But, unless you have a will of steel like my internet hero <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/30/is-a-costco-membership-worth-the-cost/\">Mr. Money Mustache,</a> you’re probably buying shit you normally wouldn’t. I’m talking about the extra pair of jeans that was on a great sale or that set of cookies that they let you sample for “free”. If it didn’t work, they wouldn’t do it right?</li></ol><p>So in the end, Costco membership doesn’t come down to just a simple question of does it justify the annual membership or not. It doesn’t. But it doesn’t for none of the reasons that most people are considering. The $60 a year annual membership is probably the least of your worries.</p><p>One caveat is that I don’t think that there is no place for Costco in the world. There are certain situation where it could be great. For example, for large families. For them, what we may think of as bulk is just regular. In that case, you could probably save a lot of money. Also, if you’re some hyper rational human who never shops emotionally, go ahead and shop there. For the rest of us, stick to clipping coupons.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6a66a55e0f11\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-bulk-sized-costco-fallacy-6a66a55e0f11\">The bulk sized Costco fallacy</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We weren’t sure what it was. So what do we do? We Google it of course. Now we’re really scared. It’s the last thing you want to read about. It could be the big C. Based on my cat’s age, and the description online it is also somewhat likely.</p><p>We go ahead and yelp the closest good vet in the neighborhood and schedule a prompt appointment for the next day. I took the kitty in and sat there anxiously as the vet inspected her carefully. Eventually she informed me she doesn’t really know what it is exactly and we’ll need to do a biopsy. Great… :-s</p><p>One thing she did recommend is to do an x-ray to make sure that if it is cancer, it didn’t spread to the lungs. If it did, there wasn’t much to treat there. Also, she was missing a couple of shots that the city enforced by law. I obliged and we went ahead with the procedure and the shots.</p><p>I sat through and waited patiently for the results to come back. Luckily, there was no sign of cancer in the lungs. A big relief to say the least. As I get ready to walk out I’m also reminded that I have to pay. They hand me a bill and ask me to go to the front desk and settle it. I open it to see the total damage. It’s well over $700. That’s just for today. The biopsy estimate is another $500.</p><p>Now don’t get me wrong. I’ll gladly pay that and much more as long as my kitty is healthy. But not everyone is able to pay $1200 and keep the lights on. For some people, that’s a very significant amount of money. Some people may need to choose between paying the vet bill and rent.</p><p>My first hint regarding the cost of treatment should have been all the posters advertising financing options. I remember looking at them and then chuckling in my mind about the absurd idea of financing bills in general. How irresponsible!</p><p>Before you start explaining to me the free market I just want to say this isn’t some cry baby, socialist plea to nationalize veterinarian treatment. I picked the best vet in the area and agreed to all the pricing ahead of time. But there was one huge thing that dawned on me that day. Something that I never truly understood until that day.</p><blockquote>The reason why money is great is not because of all the consumables you can obtain but because of the security it offers you.</blockquote><p>I swiped my credit card and walked out of that vet high as a kite thinking only about the fact that my cat didn’t have cancer that metastasized. That’s all I cared about. The $1200 I just paid will be paid off the next day and I’ll never worry about it again. That’s a very privileged but little appreciated place to be in.</p><p>I guess I understood this idea subconsciously. After all, the entire idea of being FI (financially independent) is financial security. You save enough money to be “employer independent”. It’s something I’ve been working towards for nearly a decade. But never in my life did I understand how important it is until that day.</p><p>A lot of people concentrate on the idea of not working. At least not the traditional way for some big corporation in a soul sucking cubicle job. I admit that this idea is very attractive but it’s the cherry at the top. The real benefit of FI is the security that comes with it. It’s the knowledge that no matter what, your bills will be taken care of.</p><p>You are recession proof for life. You are interest rates, stock market, bond market, and job market independent. On top of it all, life tends to throw curve balls. Those curves could in many cases improve your state. It could be a raise, a move to a different city or country or a new more lucrative job offer. Occasionally it could also be a broken transmission. Either way, you got it covered and you can sleep at night just fine. Great feeling in my mind.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6d70e5c1b9dc\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-its-good-to-be-rich-6d70e5c1b9dc\">Why it’s good to be rich</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

If you haven’t read part I, I encourage you to do so <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">here</a>. Everything will make a lot more sense if you do.</p><p>For those that have fully embraced the smartphone age and lack patience, here’s a quick summary:</p><p>Turns out what we <strong>want</strong> is frequently separate from what we <strong>like</strong>. The things we desire in life do not always bring us happiness. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective. Evolution does not care about your happiness. Its only objective is to propagate your genes. Therefore; your ancestors were rewarded when competing for status and acquiring resources. However, to be happy, you cannot simply chase your desires. Those desires must also bring you long term contentment. You can do this only if you engage both the “want system” and the “like system”.</p><p>Now that you’re up to speed, let’s dig in.</p><p>Shortly after publishing the first article about the two systems, my friend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zhiachong\">Zack</a> asked me a really interesting question.</p><blockquote>What’s an actionable item I can do today to determine what will appeal to my “want” and “like” system?</blockquote><p>I’ll be honest, I had to think long and hard about this one. My gut reaction was to write a piece bashing materialism and status seeking but I feel like it’s not very satisfying. It’s hard to convince anyone that driving a brand new Tesla SUV to work on daily basis will not bring them more happiness in life. Also, as my wife frequently reminds me, “not everyone wants to live like a monk”.</p><p>Consequently, I had to step back and reconsider. What else can you do to engage the “like system”?</p><p>We’ve already established that people are terrible at predicting how much happiness their desires will bring them. We tend to overestimate the pleasure we will gain from positive experiences. Similarly we tend to overestimate the pain we will experience from negative experiences. However, I am aware of at least one method that seems to be somewhat more reliable than our own intuition. <em>All you have to do is find someone who is at the same position you would like to be and ask them how they feel.</em></p><p>This might not be the bombshell you were expecting. However, the consequence of this idea is easy to overlook.</p><p>Consider for instance what you could do if you were buying a new house. You and your spouse might be looking for a 4 bedroom house at a near by suburb in a brand new development. It must have a 2 car garage and a ton of yard space to play ball with your future child. You will use the extra rooms as an office and an extra bedroom whenever your parents visit from out of town. Sure, it will increase your commute and the mortgage payments are a little high, but it’s worth it!</p><p>Sounds familiar? That’s because it is exactly what a typical couple does — at least around this part of town.</p><p>Before signing on the dotted line, and committing to 30 years of debt, you could ask a current home owner, roughly at the same stage of life, roughly with the same house, living in a similar neighborhood, what their day to day looks like. Do they have any regrets? Do they miss renting? How do they feel about Home Depot? What would they change if they could do it over again?</p><p>They may tell you that it’s incredible. It’s everything and more than they hoped for. They love entertaining friends on their brand new deck and all the neighbors are extremely friendly and pleasant. It’s the best decision they could have ever made.</p><p>Another possibility is that the commute is tough and stressful and the mortgage payments are stretching their finances further than they are comfortable. Maintaining it is also a daily grind.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, it is valuable information you didn’t have before. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy\">Dan Gilbert,</a> their response will also be a much better predictor of your future feelings than your own intuition.</p><p>Now let’s take it a step further. What if you didn’t just settle for asking people that are a single step ahead of you. What if you also asked people who are multiple steps ahead of you. For example, if your parents own their home, why not ask them? You could even use the same questions.</p><p>They may tell you it was a great investment and all their retirement savings are in the house. They were able to raise 2.6 children in that house and send them to the best public schools the department of education had to offer.</p><p>Similarly, they could tell you they never once in 20 years walked into that office/bedroom without a feather duster and windex in their hands. They regret not buying a smaller house and using the extra money to travel.</p><p>Again, valuable information but this time from a long term perspective.</p><p>Finally, you can take this advice to it’s logical conclusion. I hesitate to write this because it is a morbid way to think. However, the insight is absolutely invaluable. I am talking about an article appropriately titled <a href=\"https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/\">regrets of the dying</a>. It took me a long time to read this partially because I couldn’t get over how morbid it is. However, I highly encourage everyone to give it a chance. Once I got through it, I realized that the fear of regret is a very powerful reason to live right. It was also indirectly responsible for this article (and many others to come).</p><p>The regrets are of course very emotional and human. I think that all of us can predict at least half of them if we just sat down and tried to list them. Yet there is something powerfully contemplative even as I re-read them.</p><p>One regret I think would resonate with everyone is #4 — I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. This is something that could haunt you your entire life unless you devote a lot of concentrated effort to maintain these relationships. One major reason for this is our endless mobility. It is certainly a great opportunity to meet wonderful people. However, the relationships you form tend to be more shallow. Once “busyness” catches up with you, those are the first to go.</p><p>This is a focus area for myself although I will make it more official in my 2019 resolutions.</p><p>So what would these people tell you about your house choices if you somehow managed to ask them? I cannot speak for them authoritatively, but my guess is they’d tell you <em>to </em><strong><em>live</em></strong><em> your life and stop wasting your time on this shit because it really doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/dGCW_QOPKvc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kristian Gonzalez</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/prediction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1cd65d586463\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-appealing-to-the-like-system-1cd65d586463\">Happiness: appealing to the like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

That’s the section I like to visit. There, you’ll find books like “You are a bad ass” and “The subtle art of not giving a fuck” trending at the top, telling you how to live a better life. An appealing proposition in my opinion. Moreover, as we’ve discussed before, <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-you-should-read-daily-f54d4f8ec845\">reading daily is a must</a>.</p><p>One of the subjects I like most under “self-help” is the subject of happiness. It always intrigued me. If someone figured out how to eliminate heartache and sadness and live in a constant euphoria, I want to know! Turns out, it’s an active topic of research with lot’s of published data.</p><p>Now, I’ve always felt like I had a good natural intuition for happiness. Somehow, the idea of spending on fancy vacations or luxurious experiences never resonated with me quite the same way. I knew that inherently, spending my way to bliss wasn’t going to work; or at the very least, it was going to be very expensive. You can imagine how happy I was when science seemed to agree with me.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100119.Happiness\">Happiness</a></p><p>I just finished reading “Happiness, the science behind your smile”. It is another book reciting more or less what I already knew from other books on the subject. However, It also had a surprising number of insightful observations I never heard before. One of the insights was regarding our “want system” vs our “like system”.</p><p>What is a “want system” you ask? Great question. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Turns out, things that we want in life, like fancy cars, big houses and so forth, do not always make us happier. If we could somehow measure our present life satisfaction, then go out and buy a new car, several months later, our life satisfaction would be more or less the same. The sciency term for that is hedonic adaptation. In fact, the single best predictor of your life satisfaction a decade from now is not your job, education, house or marital status. It is your life satisfaction today.</p><p>In a similar fashion, we have a “like system”. That refers to those things in life that make us happy (things we like). Health, freedom, and respect are all qualities that seem to raise our life satisfaction. Yet, there are plenty of cases when we are working actively against reaching these qualities. For example, everyone knows they should exercise and eat healthy to maintain their health. However, the only time people are motivated enough to eat healthy is a month before a beach vacation.</p><p>It follows that these two systems are</p><ol><li>Distinct</li><li>Could potentially send opposing signals</li></ol><p>A perfect example of this would be volunteering. People that volunteer their time for causes they care about deeply report being happier. Yet there are millions of people everyday who come home and play Xbox (Not sure if Xbox players report being happier).</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect sense. Evolution doesn’t give two hoots about your happiness. Evolution needs you to propagate your genes. Therefore; adapting to your current situation and constantly striving for the next great thing is completely natural. That explains why it’s so hard to be happy with what you have. You’re simply not designed to.</p><p>That’s not to say that the two systems will always mislead you and diverge. There are many cases when the two systems align. For example, socializing. Our “want system” generally agrees with our “like system”. We tend to want to go out and meet our friends and we seem to enjoy our time when we do.</p><p>Another example is marriage. Married people report higher life satisfaction than their single counterparts. That makes sense. Who wants to be alone forever? Of course, it’s also possible that happier people tend to get married more frequently simply because they are more pleasant; an attribution bias 😕.</p><p>So what can you do with this information? I think this can be seen as another framework for making decisions. You evaluate the decision based on what system it appeals to. If it appeals to both, great! Easy win. Continue with what you were doing. If it appeals to one but not the other, maybe it’s a time to step back and re-evaluate. Do you really need to purchase that new iPhone? Should you call your mother or finish reading that article on CNN?</p><p>Or you can always donate all your worldly possessions and go live in a forest 🌲.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8daa263fd80a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">Happiness: our want system vs like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I flew over on Thursday and planning to stay until Monday morning. The plan is to have a surprise birthday party. My mom is making all the arrangements and it’s growing to be quite the headache with all the details but I’m sure he’s going to love it.</p><p>One thing did stand out to me though. My mom was going over some of the planning and casually mentioned that for my dad’s 50th birthday, I made him a really great montage. Everyone at his birthday loved it and since then it’s been a tradition to have one at all of their friends milestones. However, she said that for this one, it wasn’t really necessary.</p><p>Naturally, I inquired as to why she thought so and she explained that although it’s been a decade since the last video, she feels like this video would be essentially the same. “Not much has changed” was her exact quote. There was basically nothing worthy to show people.</p><p>This bothers me for several reasons. First and foremost, it bothers me because I feel sad for them. I feel like you let an entire decade slip by and haven’t even done enough with it to share the highlights with the people closest to you.</p><p>Second, the days the I do nothing tend to be the days that are least memorable (naturally). I would imagine that there is probably a similar effect to weeks, months, years and decades. You can live your entire life without doing much at all.</p><p>Finally, I was angry. I was angry because I can’t understand how she wasn’t bothered by it. Why is it okay in her mind to have your life pass you by. Of course based on my “Don’t be an asshole rule” I didn’t say any of this and I doubt she’ll ever read it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=69e6e56237b6\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-not-to-live-your-life-69e6e56237b6\">How not to live your life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Continuing on the previous idea of happiness by subtraction, what can you really do? I had this conversation with my wife the other day. She mentioned how much she doesn’t like to do laundry, cleaning and dishes.</p><p>Based on the idea if subtraction, we should do our best to eliminate these tasks. Notice that nothing is being added to our lives. I am not suggesting we get cleaner, more dishes or more dish washers (yet).</p><p>So what can you do? Here’s my rough framework. Keep in mind that I came up with it in about 15 minutes on a car ride so it may or may not be complete. I am likely to address the holes later. Long story short, you have 3 options:</p><ol><li>Elimination</li><li>Automation</li><li>Outsourcing</li></ol><p>They are in a rough order of desirability. Option (1), elimination, usually won’t cost much if at all. It alleviates a lot of problems and adult responsibilities.</p><p>Option (2) is great if possible. It may or may not cost you but aside from a little of annual maintenance usually frees up a bunch of time.</p><p>Option (3) tends to be the most expensive one. However, certain things are simply cannot be eliminated or automated (although that’s changing).</p><p>Regarding my wife’s biggest pain points, elimination didn’t seem to work but I could definitely think of some partial automation solutions that we will explore.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e0b57fe4a65f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/improving-life-e0b57fe4a65f\">Improving life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Amidst all the distraction from the likes of Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, one may ask how is it possible to stay productive at all?</p><p>In my mind, there are many things that need to be my attention. However, I usually have a tendency to delay things as long as possible. People call it many things, but I call it <em>laziness. </em>😖</p><p>It could be writing a Medium article, finishing up a chunk of code, reviewing a technical document, or just replying to an email. When I’m left to my own devices, I would basically imagine all these things in my head and feel the insurmountable amount of work that needs done…</p><p>When that grim mood sets in, my hand would instinctively reach into my pocket and pull out my phone.</p><p>This had happened to me multiple times in the past, and it still does from time to time.</p><p>But something <em>changed</em>. Once I discovered the secret cure to counter this terrible disease, I’ve been able to be 10x more productive than before, and as a direct result, bring much more joy into my life. My steps have springs in them, and my every waking day I feel a sense of mission and accomplishment.</p><p>Now, let me share with you my personal secret weapon to increase productivity.</p><h3>MOMENTUM</h3><p>That’s it, I said it. Momentum. It’s a simple word, but a powerful force.</p><blockquote>Momentum is what picks you up when you’re down, keeps you going when you’re overwhelmed, and maintains your focus when you sense distraction.</blockquote><blockquote>Momentum gets rid of triviality, and drives action.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Momentum is the power to produce.</strong></blockquote><p>When I sense that my energy level is low, and yet there are heaps of stuff left to be done, I give myself a mental pat on the back and start with one simple goal: <strong>do one thing at a time</strong>.</p><p>Let me give you an example. I started writing this article on a Tuesday evening at 10.10pm after work. I had just worked out, cleaned up the place and felt really tired.</p><p>Yet, I promised my editor (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a>) that I’ll write at least an article this week to demonstrate mindful living in my own life.</p><p>After I sat down on my bed, my first thought was, <em>“Hmm, there are other, better things I can do with my time. Let’s see what’s on Facebook before I get started…”</em></p><p>One thing led to another, and 10 minutes later I was<em> still</em> on Facebook. How often has this happened to you?</p><p>That’s when I told myself, <em>“OK, let’s try just one paragraph. Let’s see what happens…”</em></p><p>That’s the magic phrase,<strong> <em>let’s see what happens</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>Once you start doing something, the powerful magic of momentum will carry you forward without you knowing it.</p><p>Fast-forward 20 minutes later, and I’ve already written close to 500 words. Much of it will probably be edited out in post-processing, but that’s OK. I have outdone myself, and wrote more than what I set out to do.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important thing is to realize that productivity doesn’t mean getting things done to perfection. Productivity, to me, <strong>means to execute and follow-through</strong>. Getting something out there is much better than nothing at all.</p><p>Once you have momentum behind you, it is much easier to follow that flow and drive things to completion.</p><h3>Tips &amp; Tricks for Building Momentum</h3><p>Here is a list of tips &amp; tricks I use to build momentum in my daily life:</p><ul><li>I <strong>block out a chunk of time</strong> on my calendar every day for my own space. For example, on my work calendar, there’s a chunk of time from 3–5pm that is allocated for coding. I have understanding teammates who don’t book meetings on those power-hours because it’s important for me to keep sanity and have time to myself to do things I need to do.</li><li><strong>Fill in mundane tasks with something productive</strong>. Reading more books is one of my goals for this year. When I feel overwhelmed and need to get away, I’ll try to pull out a book or listen to an audiobook on Spotify. I have a book in my backpack at all times, and having something to put my mind into is very helpful in those situations. The goal here <strong>is to build a productive habit</strong>, and you can replace reading with something else like working out or taking out the trash.</li><li><strong>Set a schedule and stick to it.</strong> Working out is something I dread, yet it’s important for my overall health. Earlier this year when I sat down and analyzed why I wasn’t working out more, I realized that having to drive to the gym and mentally set myself in work-out mode was time-consuming and counter-productive. What I did, then, was I built my own little home gym. My small gym only has some free weights and a bench, but the effects are tremendous. Every day, I’ll spend 30–40 minutes in the gym either lifting or doing a quick jog. Again, I build momentum here by just showing up. <strong>80% of the battle is already won when you show up, and that’s the beauty of momentum</strong>.</li></ul><p>Those are just some examples of how I use momentum in my daily life to drive productivity. I’d like to know if you have any productivity tips to share as well!</p><h3>Credits</h3><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> for proof-reading and providing valuable feedback!</p><p><em>Zhia Chong is a student of mindful living.

You won’t see a difference until the first leaf breaks through the soil. Planting requires the right temperature, appropriate timing, sufficient lighting, and much more to be successful. Same goes with meditation; posture, frequency, and duration matter.</p><h3><strong>How long does it take?</strong></h3><p>It depends on how thick the soil is. In this analogy, it’s how self-aware you are.</p><blockquote>For me, it takes 10 minutes a day, 7 days a week, for 4 weeks to see the benefit.</blockquote><p>To experience the benefit of meditation, you need to be mindful enough. But, to be more mindful, you need to practice more meditation. Hence, at the beginning, you may not even be aware of the small changes. The progress is still under the soil.</p><p>One does not simply count their breaths to unlock the power of meditation.</p><h3><strong>Get the logistic right</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>I recommend to use guided meditation.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> is great for the beginner because it repeatedly walks through the core practices <em>(see below)</em>.</li><li><strong>Sit up right.</strong> <em>Laying down meditation never works (I tried).</em></li><li><strong>Meditate for at least 10 minutes.</strong> The mind needs enough time to calm down and adjust to the practice.</li><li><strong>Do it everyday.</strong> This is the most important rule. At the beginning, skipping one day felt almost like starting over again. Leverage the <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">power of habits</a> to see progress faster.</li></ul><h3><strong>Understand the core concept</strong></h3><p>We practice mindfulness in one of two ways: focused attention and open monitoring. They are quite different but both are essential.</p><ul><li><strong>Focused attention exercise </strong>can be done by focusing on one object like breathing. Buddhist monk practices mindful walking; paying attention to the feet that touch the ground, and the weight that pulls down due to gravity.</li></ul><blockquote><em>Focused attention exercise is helpful to sharpen the focus and overcome the distraction in day-to-day life.</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Open monitoring</strong> can be done by being aware of any sensation, thought or emotion that emerge without being attached to it. Instead of focusing on a particular object, keep the mind open to any sensations. See it appear and let it goes without processing it.</li></ul><blockquote>Open monitoring is helpful to let go of any present emotion, attachment to the past, and expectation of the future, which consumes our energy unnecessarily.</blockquote><h3><strong>Benefit</strong></h3><p>I found that practicing mindfulness strengthens the ability to follow my own thought process to a great extent. <strong>I can reach to a deeper reasoning and watch closely how ego and emotion influence any action or decision. </strong>Mindfulness also gives the clarity to my subconscious thought such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity, which are the root of my reasoning flaw. Taking time to practice mindfulness is not only important but necessary in this chaotic society.</p><p>Like physical exercise, meditation is the exercise of the mind.

It is clear that earning fulfillment along the way is as important as reaching to the end goal. A friend asked me a very important question: <em>how do we enjoy every moment while still having a sense of a future goal? </em>I think of it this way:</p><blockquote><strong>Completion of a big goal = SUM(small daily action)</strong></blockquote><p>For example, my goal to write a book is far-fetch and has always been postponed. Writing one page every week (for 3 years) actually seems more achievable! The only way to get myself to write repeatedly is to <em>build the habit around it.</em></p><h3><strong>Deliberately building habits</strong></h3><p>My favorite book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526875534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit\">Power of Habit</a> suggests that any habit consists of 3 parts.</p><blockquote>First, there is a <strong>cue</strong>, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the <strong>routine</strong>, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a <strong>reward</strong>, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop… becomes more and more automatic<em>.</em></blockquote><p>Defining the cue is crucial. What worked best for me is to select a specific time, location, and vibe all together as a cue. I pick my favorite instrumental music, and sit on the couch on Sunday morning to get my brain engaged. I do my writing routine. Then I publish it to get the readers’ feedback as a reward. It gets easier over time as the habit is formed.</p><p>Majority of the time, I forget about the overarching goal and mostly enjoy doing my routine.<strong> The right set of habits can maximize your sense of fulfillment while still keeping you on track for the long term achievement.</strong></p><h3>Replacing bad habits</h3><p>Now that we know what is the good habits to keep or create, it’s time to get rid of the not-so-good habits. The best way is to replace the routine.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Keeping the same cue and reward; substituting the routine.</em></strong></blockquote><p>Say I want to stop checking social media first thing in the morning. First, I must identify the cue and the reward. I know the cue is the sound of the alarm clock, and the reward is the feeling of being awake afterwards. I choose to replace social media with reading (since it contributes to my long term goal). I delete the social media apps and replace them with reading apps. It feel a bit different at first, but overtime, the brain gets the same reward and it adjusts to the change. This strategy works all the time as long as you understand your cue and reward.</p><p>Identifying a good habit and deliberately replacing the bad ones is a continuous process. Overtime, I come to a set of habits that I do daily.</p><h3><strong>Realize enemy of habits</strong></h3><p>Life can’t be all planned. Many times, the unplanned events must override the schedule and break your flow. It can even break the yearly habit in a day. Spontaneous habit changes must happen to match the circumstances. This is perhaps the most difficult part about operating life on a set of habits.</p><blockquote><strong>The best way to cope with change is to be self-aware, constantly reflecting upon the self and understanding our own desire.</strong></blockquote><p>Being self-aware also helps with reinforcing the habit consciously when the cues or rewards are missing. It’s a fallback mechanism to maintain a long lasting habit.</p><h3>Super Habit</h3><p>Like any other goal, self-awareness can be practiced and strengthened. I found the <strong>habit of meditation </strong>to contribute highly to self-awareness. The mind is just like the body. It needs to be well-maintained and exercised.</p><p>Meditation gives the mind a chance to reorganize all the information. It is also a practice to de-focus on the past and future, and re-focus on what happens in the present. With higher consciousness, the mind is sharpened to understand and deal with uncertainty in life better.</p><p>I would denote meditation as my super habit because it keeps all other habits together. (I will write more about this later!)</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I believe that the better the plan, the easier the execution. <em>The journey to complete your big goal must be thought through</em>. Building good set of habits and maintain them is the fastest way to get there.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6cf095b2eacd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">How I build the right set of habits</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Don’t get me wrong, I am not depressed (all my friends can testify!). In fact, I am happy, just not as much as I think I should be. Nothing is seriously wrong or need to be fixed about my life. I have a great paying job, amazing friends and brilliant co-workers, and I feel strong and healthy. Yet I still want to be happier.</p><p>For the past week, I pursued a quest to measure my own happiness. This is surprisingly difficult. The feeling of happiness is not a boolean but a scale. I can roughly estimate an average of 7/10 daily happiness level. I wonder where the missing 3 went.</p><p>Where does 7 came from, you may ask. I imagine my happiness point is derived from some sort of goal or task completion. It could be a small task like doing groceries or a bigger goal like getting a promotion. To explain my thought process better, I made a formula out of it.</p><p>Assume that one atomic unit of happiness is called <em>joy</em>. Each task or goal completion can spark X amount of <em>joy </em>based on level of challenge. My todo list on the weekend looks like this.</p><ul><li>Water a plant <em>= 5 joy after completion</em></li><li>Clean up my bathroom <em>= 30 joy after completion</em></li><li>File taxes <em>= 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium <em>= 100 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>Let’s say my threshold of happiness per day is at 100. If I complete everything in the list (even filing taxes!), I should have a very happy Saturday. Well, the truth is.. not really.</p><blockquote>The pure happiness I feel from achieving goals is only temporary. A better goal is contentment or fulfillment.</blockquote><p>The formula above fails to capture the sense of fulfillment, which comes from having a purpose and being present in the moment. That is why focusing on goal completion alone is for amateurs. We need to feel consistent fulfillment throughout the journey to the goal.</p><p>How should I represent fulfillment in this formula? Since fulfillment is all about enjoying the moment, it should perhaps be represented as <em>joy gain per minute (as long as we feel happy in those minutes)</em>. As time progresses, total fulfillment is equal to the <em>joy/min multiplied by the time spend. </em>Let’s try the formula again.</p><ul><li>Watch Netflix (1 hour)<em> = 1 joy/min + 0 joy after completion</em></li><li>File tax (3 hours) <em>= 0 joy/min + 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium (~5 hour) <em>= 0.2 joy/min + 40 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>You may argue that the fulfillment gain may not always progress linearly with time. For example, if my Medium post took more than 5 hours to write, I would gain no more fulfillment after the 5 hours past. I agree! Well, for the sake of simplicity, let’s ignore that for now and assume only the upper bound of fulfillment that you can reach. Now let’s categorize all tasks into one of the three buckets.</p><ul><li><strong>Highly fulfilling activity. </strong>The activities such as watching Netflix, or drinking with friends are highly fulfilling but provides zero achievement afterwards.</li><li><strong>Pure achievement.</strong> These activities could be painful to go through but yield accomplishment afterward such as cooking, searching for a bike to buy, or filing tax. I wish I could just finish them quickly.</li><li><strong>Highly fulfilling with sense of achievement. </strong>I have only handful of these in my life such as reading a book, learning to snowboard, or writing this blog post.</li></ul><p>This lens is helpful to detach myself from the end-goal ultra focus, and constantly reminding myself to <em>live</em> in the moment. I start thinking of my day as the combination of <em>30% fulfillment and 70% achievement and started optimizing for the third bucket.</em> Many mundane tasks like folding clothes or biking can also be extremely fulfilling and could be part of the bigger goal achievement (if you think about it hard enough).</p><blockquote>Slowly, I feel that completing the goal has become less important, but having the right balance is more crucial to my overall happiness.</blockquote><p>Thank you for reading it this far.

One of my favorite spots in my house is the kitchen cabinet, which has dozen of mason jars lined up beautifully. What is invisible to the eyes is the work that has been done to keep them organized. It especially gets harder when I use and move the jars frequently. I have to tidy up faster than the mess is formed.</p><p>That said, I can keep up well with the small cabinet, but not the entire house. In the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308\"><em>Life Changing Magic of Tidy Up</em></a><em>, </em>Mari-Kondo teached me the invaluable lesson on how to declutter. KonMari method comprises of two simple steps.</p><blockquote>Discard first, then tidy.</blockquote><p>Attempting to tidy everything would not work because within a few days everything will become cluttered again. Mari-Kondo suggests to<strong> Tidy in the right order.</strong> Always start with <em>discard</em>. Take each item in one’s hand and ask</p><blockquote>Does it spark joy?</blockquote><p><strong>If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. </strong>The things that spark true joy for you won’t always be rational. That is ok. If you are like me, you will find that majority of your possessions, unfortunately, don’t spark joy. I ended up donating more than 50% of my clothes, 80% of books and documents, and so much more in the ten full garbage bags. In the process, I discovered which items were truly precious to me.</p><p>Many of us keeps an item for fear of the future or to preserve the past. Letting go of things makes room for other things that matter more. Letting go makes tidying up significantly simpler.</p><p>The real lesson I learned here is far from where I started: <strong>letting go is more important than adding or tidying. </strong>One can live without tidying up, but one must learn how to let go. To me, the idea of decluttering a physical space prompts the need to declutter everything else such as my schedule, emotional needs, and mental state. I tried using KonMari approach on the following.</p><ul><li><strong>Relationship: Does the relationship with person X sparks joy? </strong>How do they make you feel? Again, the focus is not to unfriend everyone who doesn’t spark joy, but to re-consider how to treat the most important people in one’s life who do. The more relationship you keep in the circle, the less time you have for each individual. Discarding a relationship means spending less time with some, but more with others.</li><li><strong>Activity/Event: Does the activity sparks joy? </strong>How do you feel doing such activity or attending such event? How do you like freeing those time to do something else? This question is the best way to respect your own time. When the calendar is clear, it opens a wide range of possibilities. Discarding an activity or event means declining it to enjoy the freedom.</li><li><strong>Thoughts/feelings: Does the thought sparks joy? </strong>This question is the most life-changing to me. It brought strong awareness into the mindset. Do I still want to think of X? Do I want to feel Y? Thoughts and feelings are the hardest to discard among all (it perhaps deserves its own blog post!). Discarding the thoughts and feelings means freeing up your mind for more clarity.</li></ul><p>After decluttering, it is clear why life used to feel overwhelming. Holding on to too many things takes tremendous time and energy. It is intriguing how putting the house in order helps me find other missions that spark joy.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ea2ab72e44c5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-i-tidy-my-life-ea2ab72e44c5\">How I tidy my life</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Everyone is always trying to change something about themselves. The typical things includes the food they eat, the amount of exercise they get, how they spend their time and how they prioritize their lives. Turns out, change is harder than reading a blog online.</p><p>People are also creatures of habit. We all have our morning routines, our night routines, our commute to work routine and the web sites we visit on our lunch break routine. In fact, when we are put in new environments where executing our routines is hard, we generally tend to skip workouts and eat fried chicken for dinner.</p><p>I am going to share with you an approach that I use to form better habits. It is not fool proof. It does require some upfront investment. However, I believe it could work for almost any habit you are trying to form as long as you apply enough creativity. The system is very simple to apply. All you have to do is <em>create a system. </em>Yes, you read that right, the system is to create systems. Let me explain.</p><p>When I say “system”, I’m talking about a set of rules, or guidelines you use to guide your choices. The side effect of those rules should be that you execute your desired habit. Think of these rules as formalizing a contract with yourself. The contract has at least one rule: <em>I can have as much [A] as I want. However, before I get [A], I must do [B]</em>. This is what I call a personal contract.</p><p>The inspiration came from <a href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\">Dr. BJ Fogg</a>, a researcher in behaviour design who had a great TED talk a few years back about this exact topic.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%3Fstart%3D689%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D689&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAdKUJxjn-R8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href\">https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href</a></iframe><blockquote>If you use an existing behaviour in your life, and you put the new, tiny behaviour <em>after </em>it, you can use the existing behaviour to be the trigger.</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, over time, I noticed that simply defining the contract wasn’t always enough. Frequently, I couldn’t uphold the contract for long or I would completely forget about it. In fact, it was really a hit or miss — occasionally it would work really well but periodically it would completely fall apart.</p><p>More recently, I took a look at some personal contracts I was able to maintain for a long stretch and tried to boil it down to what made them different. I have identified four hallmarks of a good personal contract.</p><p><strong>Automatic.</strong> If you can set this up for your desired habit, your job is practically done. For example, before I spend any money, I max out my 401k. I can automate this through my paycheque contributions. Done!</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to automate certain areas of your life. Exercising effectively requires you to be doing exercise. Calling your mom once a week requires you to talk (at least for now).</p><p>However, there’s a clear subset of bad habits that can be automated away. Anything digital will naturally fall here. Do you have bad browsing behaviour? Are you spending too much time on your Twitter/Facebook/YouTube ? There’s an app for that. Are you having trouble saving or budgeting? There’s a bank for that.</p><p>The advantage of automating bad habits away is you only have that upfront cost once but you reap the dividends indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Breaks down barriers. </strong>One habit that I recently found to be absolutely effortless is the habit of eating a healthy lunch. In the past, I’ve tried cooking at home or buying out healthy lunches but inevitably you skip cooking for a few nights and end up ordering a large barbacoa burrito at Chipotle. You do it enough times and getting back to cooking regularly becomes more and more unlikely.</p><p>How many barriers can you identify with my past system? First, cooking at home is a pain in the ass. Second, when buying food outside, there are far too many temptations. Third, even if I manage to convince myself to buy a salad, in the back of my mind I’m always thinking it’s a bad a deal because I’ll stay hungry after that salad.</p><p>Here is my new approach: my current employer provides catered lunches every day. I made a personal contract with myself to eat a giant bowl of salad from the salad bar first. <strong>Once</strong> I’m finished with the bowl, I can have absolutely <strong>anything</strong> I want. There are no limits. This contract addresses all barriers I’ve had for eating a healthy lunch. I don’t have to cook anything; I am not tempted by anything else since choices are limited; and I am not getting a bad deal because I can have anything I want afterwards. I just need to get through that bowl of salad first. As an added bonus, there’s very little I can eat once I’m done with the salad. I tend to be much more ambitious when hungry.</p><p>In general, try and identify all the little excuses you are giving yourself to stop doing what you really want to be doing. Once identified, try to design your life in a way that will break down those excuses in the most effortless way possible.</p><p>Other barriers usually include, distance, accessibility and ease of use. Watch out for these.</p><p><strong>Sets the correct incentive.</strong> You know how we said before you get [A] you must do [B]? Make sure that whatever [A] is, it is motivating enough to act as a trigger. If you remember reading my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">commitments for 2018,</a> you’ll recall that one of my commitments was to drink two cups of coffee a day. Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that as time goes on, I am creeping back to three cups. Each time I have it, I feel a little guilty but I reason that starting tomorrow I’ll be better. Instead of feeling guilt, I can turn this around and use it to my advantage.</p><p>I am a member of a gym located in the same building where I work. I am making the following personal contract: each time I feel like having a third cup of coffee, I must <strong>first</strong> hit the gym. The barriers to work out are exceedingly low and now I also have a great incentive to do the right thing (the fact that I made it public is a bonus).</p><p>You can generalize this approach as well. Essentially, you sacrifice one minor bad habit to enforce and carry out a major good habit by setting up the right incentives for yourself.</p><p><strong>Consistent with the individual.</strong> Sometimes, despite all the automation, best intentions, lowest barriers, and most enticing incentives, you still fail at your habit building; and that’s okay.</p><p>Coming up with these systems is an iterative process. You will always be tinkering with them. Always trying something new. Always looking for a better way of doing things. You’ll never get it just right the very first time.</p><p>The key is to keep trying new ways of doing things and experimenting with what works for you. For example, a cup of coffee might be enough to motivate me to go to the gym. You might want a new pair of sneakers instead. If that’s your barrier, don’t bother with my system. It won’t work for you.</p><p>When I come up with great systems that work for me, I am always very proud and happy to share — just wait until I write my post about budgeting.</p><p>Let me know if you have a system you are particularly proud of. I am always looking to tweak mine and share with others.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac415f0a8c79\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-state-of-the-art-system-to-goal-setting-ac415f0a8c79\">My state of the art system to goal setting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I can’t remember exactly what we were discussing but it must have been something interesting. It usually is. Suddenly, Zack asks me the following question:</p><blockquote>Where do you see yourself in five years?</blockquote><p>I haven’t been to an interview in a long time so I was caught off guard. I didn’t have a good enough, well rehearsed and politically correct answer to give. Then again, I wasn’t being actually interviewed for a job so I told him the honest truth. The truth is, I think that planning five years ahead is pointless if not counterproductive. I am sure that every lifestyle/productivity guru on the internet is having a meltdown right now. However, let me explain.</p><p>Presumably, setting a long term goal means the outcome is important to you. It is probably something that will make you happy and make you feel like a more accomplished person. Or will it? We’ve talked about this before. <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">What you think will make you happy doesn’t always make you happy</a>. You just may end up on the hamster wheel chasing the next goal.</p><p>More importantly, the goals that you set for yourself today might not even be applicable five years from now. Let me give you a concrete example. I’ll steal this one from Nina because it works out perfectly. She mentioned that one of her friends has five year goal to open up her own brewery. That sounds really fun right? However, how sure is this friend that brewing beer is what she really wants to do? Five years from now, her priorities could change completely. Has she spent enough time brewing beer for herself? Is she sure that running her own business is something that she wants?</p><p>Another mistake a lot of people make when setting their long term goals is making goals that are outside of their control. For example, you can set a goal for yourself to get married. Is that a good goal? I don’t think so. Yes, one way to hand over more control to yourself is to lower your expectations but I don’t think that’s what you had in mind when committing to this five years earlier.</p><p>So far I’ve just been warming up. Sure, all of the above is true, but the real reason five year goals are pointless is much simpler. The unpredictability of life makes it so. For example, five years ago I was happily living in Canada when all of a sudden I got an opportunity to work at a much fancier company for much fancier pay. All my five year plans had to be abandoned (if I had any). Two days ago my wife came back from Portugal and is convinced life is better over there. What’s my five year plan now?</p><p>I can hear all the detractors from my couch grumbling under their breath about how I just don’t understand the goal setting process. It doesn’t have to be this specific or set in stone. That’s true! However, how generic are you thinking? The reality is that once you make it somewhat generic, everyone wants roughly the same. Everyone wants to be healthier, stronger, better looking with a devoted spouse and a killer job. So what? How are you getting there? The devil is in the details.</p><p>I am not here just to be a <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/\">complainypants</a>. I also like to propose solutions. So here it goes: Do whatever you do to set your five year goal but set it for only <strong>one</strong> year ahead. Do this every year. At the end of the year, reevaluate and readjust. A year is generally enough to set substantial but achievable goals. At the same time, when things change — either your surrounding or your opinions — you have plenty of opportunity to reevaluate what you value and where you’re heading.</p><p>You can experiment with shorter periods of time as well, however, I suspect that if you do this too frequently, you won’t be giving yourself enough time to complete the goal. At the same time, you’ll be giving yourself a lot of opportunities to quit. One year seems like a good balance between some level of accountability and flexibility.</p><p>The key to make this recurring one year goal work is the <strong>reevaluation</strong> part of the process. Each year, you must check back on the goals you set for yourself in the beginning of year and evaluate your performance. Furthermore, reevaluate if you want to continue with this goal. Finally, and most importantly, step up the difficulty level of the goal.</p><p>I think of this as “managed personal growth”. <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2018 should be better in every way than <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2017.

If you haven’t read part I, I encourage you to do so <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">here</a>. Everything will make a lot more sense if you do.</p><p>For those that have fully embraced the smartphone age and lack patience, here’s a quick summary:</p><p>Turns out what we <strong>want</strong> is frequently separate from what we <strong>like</strong>. The things we desire in life do not always bring us happiness. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary perspective. Evolution does not care about your happiness. Its only objective is to propagate your genes. Therefore; your ancestors were rewarded when competing for status and acquiring resources. However, to be happy, you cannot simply chase your desires. Those desires must also bring you long term contentment. You can do this only if you engage both the “want system” and the “like system”.</p><p>Now that you’re up to speed, let’s dig in.</p><p>Shortly after publishing the first article about the two systems, my friend <a href=\"https://medium.com/@zhiachong\">Zack</a> asked me a really interesting question.</p><blockquote>What’s an actionable item I can do today to determine what will appeal to my “want” and “like” system?</blockquote><p>I’ll be honest, I had to think long and hard about this one. My gut reaction was to write a piece bashing materialism and status seeking but I feel like it’s not very satisfying. It’s hard to convince anyone that driving a brand new Tesla SUV to work on daily basis will not bring them more happiness in life. Also, as my wife frequently reminds me, “not everyone wants to live like a monk”.</p><p>Consequently, I had to step back and reconsider. What else can you do to engage the “like system”?</p><p>We’ve already established that people are terrible at predicting how much happiness their desires will bring them. We tend to overestimate the pleasure we will gain from positive experiences. Similarly we tend to overestimate the pain we will experience from negative experiences. However, I am aware of at least one method that seems to be somewhat more reliable than our own intuition. <em>All you have to do is find someone who is at the same position you would like to be and ask them how they feel.</em></p><p>This might not be the bombshell you were expecting. However, the consequence of this idea is easy to overlook.</p><p>Consider for instance what you could do if you were buying a new house. You and your spouse might be looking for a 4 bedroom house at a near by suburb in a brand new development. It must have a 2 car garage and a ton of yard space to play ball with your future child. You will use the extra rooms as an office and an extra bedroom whenever your parents visit from out of town. Sure, it will increase your commute and the mortgage payments are a little high, but it’s worth it!</p><p>Sounds familiar? That’s because it is exactly what a typical couple does — at least around this part of town.</p><p>Before signing on the dotted line, and committing to 30 years of debt, you could ask a current home owner, roughly at the same stage of life, roughly with the same house, living in a similar neighborhood, what their day to day looks like. Do they have any regrets? Do they miss renting? How do they feel about Home Depot? What would they change if they could do it over again?</p><p>They may tell you that it’s incredible. It’s everything and more than they hoped for. They love entertaining friends on their brand new deck and all the neighbors are extremely friendly and pleasant. It’s the best decision they could have ever made.</p><p>Another possibility is that the commute is tough and stressful and the mortgage payments are stretching their finances further than they are comfortable. Maintaining it is also a daily grind.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, it is valuable information you didn’t have before. According to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy\">Dan Gilbert,</a> their response will also be a much better predictor of your future feelings than your own intuition.</p><p>Now let’s take it a step further. What if you didn’t just settle for asking people that are a single step ahead of you. What if you also asked people who are multiple steps ahead of you. For example, if your parents own their home, why not ask them? You could even use the same questions.</p><p>They may tell you it was a great investment and all their retirement savings are in the house. They were able to raise 2.6 children in that house and send them to the best public schools the department of education had to offer.</p><p>Similarly, they could tell you they never once in 20 years walked into that office/bedroom without a feather duster and windex in their hands. They regret not buying a smaller house and using the extra money to travel.</p><p>Again, valuable information but this time from a long term perspective.</p><p>Finally, you can take this advice to it’s logical conclusion. I hesitate to write this because it is a morbid way to think. However, the insight is absolutely invaluable. I am talking about an article appropriately titled <a href=\"https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/\">regrets of the dying</a>. It took me a long time to read this partially because I couldn’t get over how morbid it is. However, I highly encourage everyone to give it a chance. Once I got through it, I realized that the fear of regret is a very powerful reason to live right. It was also indirectly responsible for this article (and many others to come).</p><p>The regrets are of course very emotional and human. I think that all of us can predict at least half of them if we just sat down and tried to list them. Yet there is something powerfully contemplative even as I re-read them.</p><p>One regret I think would resonate with everyone is #4 — I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. This is something that could haunt you your entire life unless you devote a lot of concentrated effort to maintain these relationships. One major reason for this is our endless mobility. It is certainly a great opportunity to meet wonderful people. However, the relationships you form tend to be more shallow. Once “busyness” catches up with you, those are the first to go.</p><p>This is a focus area for myself although I will make it more official in my 2019 resolutions.</p><p>So what would these people tell you about your house choices if you somehow managed to ask them? I cannot speak for them authoritatively, but my guess is they’d tell you <em>to </em><strong><em>live</em></strong><em> your life and stop wasting your time on this shit because it really doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/dGCW_QOPKvc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Kristian Gonzalez</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/search/photos/prediction?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1cd65d586463\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-appealing-to-the-like-system-1cd65d586463\">Happiness: appealing to the like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

That’s the section I like to visit. There, you’ll find books like “You are a bad ass” and “The subtle art of not giving a fuck” trending at the top, telling you how to live a better life. An appealing proposition in my opinion. Moreover, as we’ve discussed before, <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-you-should-read-daily-f54d4f8ec845\">reading daily is a must</a>.</p><p>One of the subjects I like most under “self-help” is the subject of happiness. It always intrigued me. If someone figured out how to eliminate heartache and sadness and live in a constant euphoria, I want to know! Turns out, it’s an active topic of research with lot’s of published data.</p><p>Now, I’ve always felt like I had a good natural intuition for happiness. Somehow, the idea of spending on fancy vacations or luxurious experiences never resonated with me quite the same way. I knew that inherently, spending my way to bliss wasn’t going to work; or at the very least, it was going to be very expensive. You can imagine how happy I was when science seemed to agree with me.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100119.Happiness\">Happiness</a></p><p>I just finished reading “Happiness, the science behind your smile”. It is another book reciting more or less what I already knew from other books on the subject. However, It also had a surprising number of insightful observations I never heard before. One of the insights was regarding our “want system” vs our “like system”.</p><p>What is a “want system” you ask? Great question. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Turns out, things that we want in life, like fancy cars, big houses and so forth, do not always make us happier. If we could somehow measure our present life satisfaction, then go out and buy a new car, several months later, our life satisfaction would be more or less the same. The sciency term for that is hedonic adaptation. In fact, the single best predictor of your life satisfaction a decade from now is not your job, education, house or marital status. It is your life satisfaction today.</p><p>In a similar fashion, we have a “like system”. That refers to those things in life that make us happy (things we like). Health, freedom, and respect are all qualities that seem to raise our life satisfaction. Yet, there are plenty of cases when we are working actively against reaching these qualities. For example, everyone knows they should exercise and eat healthy to maintain their health. However, the only time people are motivated enough to eat healthy is a month before a beach vacation.</p><p>It follows that these two systems are</p><ol><li>Distinct</li><li>Could potentially send opposing signals</li></ol><p>A perfect example of this would be volunteering. People that volunteer their time for causes they care about deeply report being happier. Yet there are millions of people everyday who come home and play Xbox (Not sure if Xbox players report being happier).</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect sense. Evolution doesn’t give two hoots about your happiness. Evolution needs you to propagate your genes. Therefore; adapting to your current situation and constantly striving for the next great thing is completely natural. That explains why it’s so hard to be happy with what you have. You’re simply not designed to.</p><p>That’s not to say that the two systems will always mislead you and diverge. There are many cases when the two systems align. For example, socializing. Our “want system” generally agrees with our “like system”. We tend to want to go out and meet our friends and we seem to enjoy our time when we do.</p><p>Another example is marriage. Married people report higher life satisfaction than their single counterparts. That makes sense. Who wants to be alone forever? Of course, it’s also possible that happier people tend to get married more frequently simply because they are more pleasant; an attribution bias 😕.</p><p>So what can you do with this information? I think this can be seen as another framework for making decisions. You evaluate the decision based on what system it appeals to. If it appeals to both, great! Easy win. Continue with what you were doing. If it appeals to one but not the other, maybe it’s a time to step back and re-evaluate. Do you really need to purchase that new iPhone? Should you call your mother or finish reading that article on CNN?</p><p>Or you can always donate all your worldly possessions and go live in a forest 🌲.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8daa263fd80a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">Happiness: our want system vs like system</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In this case, this honour falls on my good friend Nick. Nick is a great guy. He is super smart. He is always looking to grow as an individual. Most importantly, he is open minded. We also happen to share a lot of interest in the world of personal finance, minimalism and happiness.</p><p>Nick and I decided to grab a bite at a wonderful Mexican establishment in the city. We sat down, ordered our drinks and chatted about what we’ve been up to recently. Turns out, he’s been reading <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com\">Mr. Money Mustache</a>’s blog for the last couple of weeks and really likes it. He’s just got one concern. Apparently, “Mr. Money Mustache (Pete) is too extreme”.</p><p>Specifically, he was bothered by the idea that Pete hasn’t spent any money on clothing in an entire year (at least according to his <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/05/19/2016-spending/\">budget</a>). Pete’s choices of clothing revolved around free event t-shirts and some fashion advice from Costco. This did not resonate well with Nick. His look is much more sophisticated. Therefore; that idea of spending less on clothing was outright rejected.</p><p>I tried to reason with him. I told him that spending more on clothing won’t necessarily make him any happier (the happiness argument); that we tend to have piles of clothes we don’t know what to do with (the minimalism argument); that it’s a depreciating good we waste our money on but adds very little value (the money argument) and so on. Nothing worked. I just wasn’t getting through to him.</p><p>That left me wondering. How could a perfectly rational person not realize that not spending thousands of dollars a year on clothing is a perfectly legitimate way of living?</p><p>Of course, this article is not about a particular incident but an illustration of a much more common phenomena. It’s the phenomena of being presented with a perfectly valid argument for a great idea but failing to accept the (implied) conclusion. In other words, a great idea is rejected due to errors in judgment. So, after some deeper contemplation and inner examination I realized there are three distinct reasons someone could reject an idea.</p><p><strong>The idea is too novice. </strong>You have probably experienced this before. Someone is giving you advice on a topic you are far more familiar with. The idea is rudimentary, which you’ve considered many times before and dismissed for good reasons. For example, if you’ve just learned the difference between a traditional and Roth 401k, don’t bother telling me about all the benefits of Roth. I’ve already considered them and chose to go with the traditional route.</p><p>It is not because your idea is bad or assumptions are wrong. In fact, it’s great that you took the time to learn the difference (most people don’t). It’s because I’ve done plenty of research on the topic and I’m comfortable with the concept. Roth is not a bad option. However, in many cases, the traditional route can be more advantageous. It’s a conscious decision.</p><p>The best part is that you know perfectly well when this is your reason for rejecting someone’s idea. You know it because you see the conclusion coming from a mile away. This is the best place to be since there is practically no risk that you are making a mistake. It is <strong>not</strong> a judgment error.</p><p><strong>“Limiting beliefs” are stopping me from adopting this idea. </strong>I’ll be honest. I borrowed this phrase from <a href=\"https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-invisible-scripts-that-guide-our-lives/\">Ramit Sethi</a> but the idea stands! This is actually a very deep concept that requires it’s own article. However, for the sake of clarity I will summarize it as follows:</p><blockquote>It is the silent beliefs carried with you that dictate your actions. These beliefs tell you what you <strong>can’t</strong> do.</blockquote><p>It’s a very powerful concept and I encourage everyone to explore it further (or wait for a follow up article). To further illustrate this, imagine being overweight your entire life. Obtaining a muscular physique is likely out of the realm of possibilities; mostly because you don’t believe you can achieve it. The number of excuses can be endless. You can blame it on your genes; or your parents; or your hungry BFF. The common theme here is that you believe it’s out of your control. Therefore; a limiting belief and an a likely error in judgment.</p><p><strong>The idea conflicts with my life choices. </strong>When this happens, you must toy with the possibility that there was an error in your perception of the world; possibly your entire adult life; and at the risk of facing some serious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\">cognitive dissonance</a>. A second option is to find any and every possible reason to explain why that particular idea cannot work for you in your particular circumstances. The second option is the road most often taken.</p><p>For instance, imagine we are talking about transportation and I am trying to convince you that you don’t need a car. I’ll tell you about all the wonderful environmental benefits of not owning a car; the cash you’ll save; the exercise you’ll get; the longer life you’ll enjoy. I’ll even present you with alternative modes of transportation you can use such as a bike or bus. I’ll even throw in the time you’ll free up to read just like you always wanted so you could be the person you always thought you should be.</p><p>What will your reaction be? If you’re considering this idea, You have two choices. Either you must admit to yourself that maybe you’re not that savvy, discerning, environmentally friendly consumer you’ve always thought you were. You must also admit that since you’ve started working, your commute was irrational. Alternatively, you can come up with every reason why that can’t possibly work for you. The bus is irregular and unreliable. The bike can get a flat and you don’t know how to fix it. You can’t be late to work and your Uber driver can get lost in your neighbourhood. Thus; you justify the status quo instead of facing the hard truth.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is distinctly different from a limiting belief. You are not rejecting the idea because of some “invisible script” running your life. You are rejecting the idea because its conclusion is too hard to bear.</p><p>What’s interesting about this error in judgement is how easy it is to identify it. All you have to do is look at your immediate reaction. Are you looking for a list of excuses as to why this won’t work for you? Is someone challenging your assumption and it’s making you uncomfortable? Welcome my friend. You’re experiencing cognitive dissonance and you might want to reconsider your stance.</p><p>I have definitely used all three reasons when rejecting great ideas. Now that I’ve identified them, I hope it will be easier for me (and you) to notice them and make better decisions.</p><p>If you’re wondering, I think my friend Nick was experiencing a conflict with his life choices. I’m sure he knows that spending thousands on clothing is not necessarily in his best interest. He also knows that money would be better spent buying an index fund. However, to admit that, he would also need to admit that he wasted thousands of dollars in the last 10 years. That would contradict his view of himself as a savvy consumer. Hence, it’s easier to argue that refraining from spending thousands on clothes is extreme. Of course, this is assuming that what Mr. Money Mustache does is a good idea.</p><p><strong>addendum</strong></p><p>Read <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nimatohid/does-what-you-wear-matter-93170ed251fe\">the Tohidian</a> for Nick’s rebuttal.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=558c843eb939\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">Why would anyone reject a good idea</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I can’t remember exactly what we were discussing but it must have been something interesting. It usually is. Suddenly, Zack asks me the following question:</p><blockquote>Where do you see yourself in five years?</blockquote><p>I haven’t been to an interview in a long time so I was caught off guard. I didn’t have a good enough, well rehearsed and politically correct answer to give. Then again, I wasn’t being actually interviewed for a job so I told him the honest truth. The truth is, I think that planning five years ahead is pointless if not counterproductive. I am sure that every lifestyle/productivity guru on the internet is having a meltdown right now. However, let me explain.</p><p>Presumably, setting a long term goal means the outcome is important to you. It is probably something that will make you happy and make you feel like a more accomplished person. Or will it? We’ve talked about this before. <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">What you think will make you happy doesn’t always make you happy</a>. You just may end up on the hamster wheel chasing the next goal.</p><p>More importantly, the goals that you set for yourself today might not even be applicable five years from now. Let me give you a concrete example. I’ll steal this one from Nina because it works out perfectly. She mentioned that one of her friends has five year goal to open up her own brewery. That sounds really fun right? However, how sure is this friend that brewing beer is what she really wants to do? Five years from now, her priorities could change completely. Has she spent enough time brewing beer for herself? Is she sure that running her own business is something that she wants?</p><p>Another mistake a lot of people make when setting their long term goals is making goals that are outside of their control. For example, you can set a goal for yourself to get married. Is that a good goal? I don’t think so. Yes, one way to hand over more control to yourself is to lower your expectations but I don’t think that’s what you had in mind when committing to this five years earlier.</p><p>So far I’ve just been warming up. Sure, all of the above is true, but the real reason five year goals are pointless is much simpler. The unpredictability of life makes it so. For example, five years ago I was happily living in Canada when all of a sudden I got an opportunity to work at a much fancier company for much fancier pay. All my five year plans had to be abandoned (if I had any). Two days ago my wife came back from Portugal and is convinced life is better over there. What’s my five year plan now?</p><p>I can hear all the detractors from my couch grumbling under their breath about how I just don’t understand the goal setting process. It doesn’t have to be this specific or set in stone. That’s true! However, how generic are you thinking? The reality is that once you make it somewhat generic, everyone wants roughly the same. Everyone wants to be healthier, stronger, better looking with a devoted spouse and a killer job. So what? How are you getting there? The devil is in the details.</p><p>I am not here just to be a <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/\">complainypants</a>. I also like to propose solutions. So here it goes: Do whatever you do to set your five year goal but set it for only <strong>one</strong> year ahead. Do this every year. At the end of the year, reevaluate and readjust. A year is generally enough to set substantial but achievable goals. At the same time, when things change — either your surrounding or your opinions — you have plenty of opportunity to reevaluate what you value and where you’re heading.</p><p>You can experiment with shorter periods of time as well, however, I suspect that if you do this too frequently, you won’t be giving yourself enough time to complete the goal. At the same time, you’ll be giving yourself a lot of opportunities to quit. One year seems like a good balance between some level of accountability and flexibility.</p><p>The key to make this recurring one year goal work is the <strong>reevaluation</strong> part of the process. Each year, you must check back on the goals you set for yourself in the beginning of year and evaluate your performance. Furthermore, reevaluate if you want to continue with this goal. Finally, and most importantly, step up the difficulty level of the goal.</p><p>I think of this as “managed personal growth”. <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2018 should be better in every way than <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2017.

That means my favourite time of year is coming. It’s that special time when you make new year resolutions which you will break in February. All the good intentions and wishful thinking that comes head to head with the cold hard reality. What a beautiful thing.</p><p>Since I’m painfully aware of how hard it is to stick to new year resolutions, over the years I’ve come up with a pretty intricate system of rules and reminders to allow me to meet my goals. This is going to be a short summary of how I make my new year resolutions and a plea for all of you dear readers to come up with your own.</p><p>Let’s start with what you shouldn’t do. You should not, by any means, make bullshit new year resolutions. I’m talking about resolutions such as “be happy with what I have” or “be kinder to myself” (You know who I’m talking about). This sort of resolutions are completely useless for two reasons.</p><p>First, resolutions should not be abstract. It has to be something reasonably concrete. Ideally something that you can point to and say, look I did that. For example, completing a certain long standing project would be a very concrete goal whose success you can measure.</p><p>Second, it needs to be something you can break up into smaller steps. That way you can implement it throughout the year. For example, if you want to read 12 books in 2018, each book would be a step that brings you closer to your goal. Being kind to yourself is a failure on both criteria.</p><p>But enough with negativity. Let’s talk about what you should do. Since I’m old, with a vast amount of experience through my years of failure, I’ve discovered one key attribute that will make meeting your new year resolutions 10 times easier. The key to meetings them is <strong>accountability.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/315/1*DBGdHlkB6DVjBy62d3TANQ.gif\" /></figure><p>Yes I know, it’s a pretty obvious statement but it doesn’t tell much does it? So here’s the three things that I did in 2017 and found extremely helpful.</p><p><strong>Write your goals down. </strong>To be honest, I’ve read more books than I can count that advised me to write something down on a piece of paper. I never did. It’s a pain in the ass. Not to mention I’ll probably lose the paper. However, writing down your goals is important because you’re likely going to forget them. Unless of course you’re always wishing to lose weight.</p><p>Additionally, writing them down can be really easy in something like Google Sheets. You pop it open, write a few things and it’s saved for eternity. That’s what I’ve done. As a side benefit, if you keep up this habit, you get to see what you were trying to achieve over the years as long as you reuse the same spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>Write down the steps for each goal. </strong>So remember what not to do #2? Make sure you do the opposite when picking your goals and then in that same spreadsheet, under each goal, write down the practical steps you can do to meet your goal. For example, if your goal is to take better care of your health, you can list things like work out frequency and diet changes that you will be implementing as part of the goal.</p><p><strong>Grade yourself regularly. </strong>Here’s how it works. Open up whatever calendar you use and create a recurring event once every two months to remind you to check in on your goals. Each time you check in, give yourself a grade for each step and an overall grade for the goal itself. This works well because you get a regular reminder of what it is that you were trying to do for the year.</p><p>The conventional way of declaring a new year resolution on December 31st fizzles out quickly as life piles on with commitments and obligations. I would argue that most people can’t even remember their new year resolution from 2016 and definitely not from 2015. By reminding yourself what you wanted to achieve for the year, each time you veer off course, you get an opportunity to realign.</p><p>I have a check in coming up on December 28th for all my resolutions for 2017. I’ll post them on the blog together with my resolutions for next year. Stay tuned.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c043c0e69e97\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-favourite-part-of-new-year-c043c0e69e97\">My favourite part of new year</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Nothing unusual so far and that’s more or less what you’d expect people our age to talk about. It was a great night and it was nice to catch up with everyone. While talking specifically about children and inquiring about why anyone wanted them, one thing that was brought up very casually and without much resistance from the rest of the room was the idea that they will be there to teach you things. Sort of the way I do with my mom and you do with your mom and dad.</p><p>Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with learning from your kids. If my kid ends up being a surgeon, I would love to get her opinion about all sorts of health related issues. After all, she has medical training and I don’t. But despite their denial, that was not what my friends were trying to say at all. Instead, it was this underlying assumption that once you got old, you’re just not expected to perform well. Both mentally and physically. And it’s normal. If I was to challenge that idea, obviously they’d deny it but you could tell this was the assumption going into the conversation based on the context and where it was going.</p><p>I’m not going to pretend that once you hit 30, you are not less likely to make it to the NBA if you haven’t yet. There’s definitely diminishing physical abilities after a certain age (with very notable exceptions). But what bothers me is the lack of any sort of attempt to compensate for that. If you’re worried about your physical performance as you hit 50, why not double your gym time instead of just throwing your hands up in the air and say “that’s just the way it is”. I guarantee you there are people double my age who can bench press twice my weight. They just have a different attitude.</p><p>Similarly, I think that people that expect less mentally from older people, will expect less from themselves when their older. In turn, their abilities to understand and learn will quickly diminish with age. On the other hand, there’s older people who are still brilliant and who are able to maintain their mental clarity until their last day. What makes them so different? I think to some extent it’s their attitude.</p><p>That’s exactly the kind of attitude I want to cultivate in myself. I don’t think that when I’m 50 I’ll bench press less. I think I’ll bench press more. When I’m 50, I won’t be taking 10 pills a day. I’ll take none. I’ll feel great and I’m sure of it. I just need to make sure that I take care of myself now. This is the kind of attitude I would expect everyone to have.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=75eeecb3262\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/self-fulfilling-prophecies-75eeecb3262\">Self fulfilling prophecies</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I was looking forward to earning money. My pay was going to be in the thousands. I was excited to wear dress shirts and pants and walk around downtown looking important. It was a big change from my university days. Then the recession happened.</p><p>I wasn’t knowledgeable enough to understand it at the time. I know some people struggled to find work. My dad lost his job. It would take him another 8 months to find another. I, on the other hand, being a phenomenal performer, was spared (thankfully).</p><p>I do remember the protests on wall street and all the TV coverage they got. They called themselves the 99%. I must have been one of them.</p><p>We were angry about the bailouts. The bankers were saved from bankruptcy despite being responsible for the crash — and our money was used to save them!</p><p>It certainly seemed unfair to me.</p><p>But what could we do? Letting these companies fail would mean the loss of thousands of additional jobs. “It would cripple the economy”.</p><p>We also set a certain expectation. The corporations now understood: once you got large enough, the tax payer will bail you out. We even coined the term “too big to fail”.</p><p>Last week, my friend Ivan and I were discussing this exact topic. What could we do about it? And how could we have avoided this? This time however, being more mature and sophisticated, I’ve had the clarity to voice an alternative opinion. I thought it would be good to share it here with you, dear audience.</p><p>Ask yourself, what does GEICO do to insure your claim? They charge a premium of course. You pay a monthly fee for the <strong>insurance</strong> that someone will cover you in case of a loss. Naturally, you cover for large losses that would hurt you financially.</p><p>You might see where I’m going with this.</p><p>We can determine which companies are “too big to fail”; we can use an income or employee count threshold or another metric (or a combination). Once a company crosses that income level (or employee count), each additional dollar earned would be subject to double the tax rate.</p><p>Before all my libertarian friends lose their shit, let me explain.</p><p>You can view the additional tax as a premium paid into a bailout fund. In case of gross mismanagement and undue risk, the responsibility of bailing out these large corporation doesn’t fall on the tax payer but on the companies themselves.</p><p>In reality, no prudent corporation would be willing to pay more tax than necessary. Instead, as the corporation approaches this limit, they will likely split into sub-units.</p><p>Amazon would become Amazon AWS and Amazon Retail; Microsoft would become Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows, Walmart would become Walmart East and Walmart West. You get the idea.</p><p>I’d be lying if I told you I came up with this idea myself. This is taken from <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f138bf5466fe\">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> and his excellent book “<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QtaqLM\">The Black Swan</a>” (no relation to the movie).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan\">The Black Swan</a></p><p>For every great idea, there’s going to be <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/why-would-anyone-reject-a-good-idea-558c843eb939\">some detractors</a>.</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered=\"true\"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-align=\"center\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p>For Google or Amazon the &#39;break them up!&#39; argument is even less coherent, since these companies do not have clearly separate divisions with stand-alone viability.

You really can’t think of a way to break up Amazon? Amazon does <strong>everything</strong>.</p><p>And Google? It happens to be a great example of this principal — although in a much milder form. It has a holding company, Alphabet, and it spins out experimental companies, Waymo, Sidewalk Labs, etc.</p><p>Also, no company is forced to spin out every single line of business they have. If a business isn’t mature yet to stand on its own — if it’s a money loser for example — keep it. Every decision is completely up to the board and shareholders.</p><p>Finally, some people are worried that large companies will lose their competitive advantage; efficiencies of scale or something along those lines. Maybe. But that’s debatable. It could equally play out in the opposite direction.</p><p>Imagine for instance if Amazon decided to spin out its warehousing operations. Wouldn’t other companies benefit from all the efficiencies gained by Amazon?</p><p>You might be asking if a company would even bother investing in innovation if they’ll spin it off. My answer to you is of course! The investment in innovation doesn’t just disappear. It is sold. A shareholder with one share of Amazon, after the split, would end up with one share of Amazon — priced X dollars lower— and one share of the new company — priced at X. That’s just how spin offs work.</p><p>The end result of such policy is no corporate bailouts, no Dodd, no Frank, no endless bickering, no bureaucrats and no government agencies.

As of the latest Google search, his net worth exceeds $140 billion dollars. That’s billion with a ‘B’.</p><p>I was chatting with my neighbour Esther the other day about her upcoming move to Portland. Turns out the hot housing market in Seattle created irresistible conditions for a post-retirement, single woman to move to a cheaper cost of living area. As a side benefit, she will also be much closer to her kids. While I’m sad to see her go, I can’t help but feel excited about what that means for the value of my own house across the street. That feeling really makes up for her loss.</p><p>If you live in Seattle, and you’re not talking about the housing market, the next natural topic to bring up is the homeless situation which we turned to next. We both noticed a significant uptick in homelessness around the neighbourhood. We both agreed that it is being mishandled and something must be done. She even suggested Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, should do something about it. After all, “He’s got $100 billion dollars. Who needs that kind of money?”.</p><p>Wait a second …</p><blockquote>“Who needs that kind of money?”</blockquote><p>Now I have a problem with that. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t disagree that $100 (now $140) billion dollars is an absurd amount of money to have. I don’t disagree that he is probably financially independent; that he could retire early; that he doesn’t need to worry about skyrocketing health care costs and a single day fluctuation in his net worth is more money than I’ll see in a life time.</p><p>What I do disagree with is the following: Since when are we in the business of deciding who’s had enough?</p><p>There is a multitude of reasons why the statement above is wrong — both politically, economically and morally. Many of which are out of scope for this article. I do want to focus on one in particular though.</p><p>Jeff Bezos started a company. He created a great product. Millions of people are using it everyday. He revolutionized many industries. He created <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf98680c-738f-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c\">thousands of jobs</a>. The money is his reward. Is the reward large? yes. But so is his impact. We are talking about an $800 billion dollar company.</p><p>Was there any coercion? Did anyone force us to hand over our hard earned money to him? Did he do anything illegal? Did you truly love Barnes &amp; Noble?</p><p>No. In fact, we did it all out of our own free will.</p><p>Would it be great if Jeff decided to shower the city of Seattle with hundred dollar bills until the entire homeless population and all our city representatives are living in luxury?</p><p>Yes, that would be great. If so he chooses.</p><p>One of the great things about living in a free society is the freedom to choose. Jeff can decide to spend his money any way he wants to.

Effectively, this means that the interest is paid using pretax dollars. Great! let’s all go buy houses.</p><p>Not so fast. Take anyone with any sort of economic sense and they will tell you there is no free lunch here. You’re not getting stuff cheaper. By subsidizing the payments, the government simply pushed the prices of housing up for everyone. If you don’t believe me, answer this question: What do you think would happen if this was taken away now? If you said people would freak out and the prices would fall because payments are higher then reverse this argument.</p><p>Alright, so we know governments generally can’t get shit right and a lot of policies are misguided. Does that mean this one is also just a big fat waste of money? That’s sort of what I thought. At least until yesterday. Yesterday, I watched this video:</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtYWhdzYnjmc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtYWhdzYnjmc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtYWhdzYnjmc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/296303c6842968504378b9460fdbbc9e/href\">https://medium.com/media/296303c6842968504378b9460fdbbc9e/href</a></iframe><p>There were a couple of interesting points of conversation there. One in particular that caught my attention though was regarding this exact topic and your level of taxation. You see, since every owner gets to take advantage of this particular piece of policy, they save at the same rate as their marginal tax rate. On the other hand, the amount that this house went up in price due to this particular policy is roughly equal to the overall average marginal tax rate in the United States.</p><p>So what does that mean? That means that if you are at a higher margin tax rate then the average population, you’d save money based on this policy. If you’re in a lower tax bracket, you lose. The only additional point I’d like to make is that it is probably the average margin tax rate of an average house buyer. The poorest citizens probably keep renting.</p><blockquote>So this entire policy is not only making housing more expensive for everyone, but it is oddly also a subsidy for the rich by the poor.</blockquote><p>I’m not talking about tax cuts here that are great for everyone but happen to benefit the rich more (due to their larger tax bill in the first place). This is literally a transfer from the poor to the rich.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=44c2f845876\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/mortgage-interest-deduction-lies-44c2f845876\">Mortgage interest deduction lies</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, one thing got me really excited today. There were all these rumors that Trump was suppose to double our standard deduction.</p><p>I’ve been reading about this for a few months now but today’s reports made it all but certain. Now, I am not interested in discussing if this is good or bad. All I’m trying to say is it’s good for <strong>me</strong>. Or so I thought at least.</p><p>Turns out, just like everything else Trump does, it’s just a sleight of hands. While they are trying to sell it as a tax break for us in reality it’s probably a slight tax hike or almost meaningless tax break. The reason is that although the standard deduction is doubled, the personal exemption is eliminated. On top of it, the bottom tax bracket is actually going up from 10% to 12%.</p><p>So bottom line is, not much to get excited about.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4a2e7ba60b32\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/about-the-new-tax-proposals-4a2e7ba60b32\">About the new tax proposals</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

One of them is called an ESPP or employee stock purchase plan. It is a scheme by which the employer incentivizes you to purchase its stock using a portion of your salary. The incentive is usually some sort of a discount or top up.</p><p>One question that frequently comes up is what to do once the shares are vested into your account.</p><p>You can go down one of two roads. First, you can sell all the shares immediately and purchase something else. Spoiler alert, I’m in this camp.</p><p>Second, you can keep the shares.</p><p>The reasoning for keeping the shares is actually quite solid. If you’ve made money on the stock market and you’ve held the shares for less than a year, you are subject to good old fashion <strong>income</strong> tax. If, on the other hand, you held it for more than a year, you are subject to shiny new <strong>capital gains</strong> tax; and you guessed it, the shiny new capital gains taxes are usually lower.</p><p>This is exactly the argument I was having with my friend Aaron at work yesterday. Our shares from ESPP are set to vest in November and he was inquiring about my plans for the money. I told him I was going to sell everything and purchase a boring and dull index fund. He told me I was crazy for throwing my money away.</p><p>This discussion went on for longer then I am ready to admit but I thought I can summarize the lessons here. Also, since this is my blog, my opinion is right.</p><p>Let’s start with an example: Since Aaron is a well paid executive of a small company, his household income is $300,000. That puts Aaron at the 24% tax bracket. Aaron’s company offers a 15% discount on the share price. Finally, Aaron commits $20,000 to the ESPP plan.</p><p>First, it’s important to note that only your gains are taxed — not your entire investment. In this case, if you were to sell the shares immediately after vesting, your discount would be your only gain. In other words, 15% of $20,000 or $3000.</p><p>Second, uncle Sam would come calling for his portion of those $3000 at the end of the year. His share would be 24% of $3000 or $720 — that’s what you owe the government.</p><p>Third, if you were to keep the shares for a year, you are still not scot-free. The capital gains tax is still 15% of $3000 or $450.</p><p>By holding on to the shares for an entire year, you’ve saved yourself less than $270 ($720 minus $450) or roughly 1% of the entire sum. To put that into perspective, my company’s stock went down 4% yesterday (and up 17% today).</p><p>I don’t know about you but that does not seem like a good deal to me. Putting money in a single company is notoriously volatile. Doing it with the company you work for is a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1008712386485424000\">potential disaster</a>.</p><p>Of course, this is a somewhat contrived example. There are many other things to take into account</p><ol><li>If you’re filing individually and earning above $200,000, the <strong>gap </strong>between the income tax and capital gains tax is 20% instead of 9%. If you’re earning $38,000, the gap is actually negative (the income tax is lower). You can find the latest rates <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/\">here</a>.</li><li>If you contribute significantly more than $20,000 into the ESPP program your tax loss might be greater. Of course, that also means you must keep more money in a single stock.</li><li>If the incentive from your employer is larger, your tax could be greater. For example, when purchasing ESPP shares, my employer uses either the price today or the one from 6 months ago — whichever one is lower. As of this writing, the stock is up 10% from 6 months ago. My taxable gain is now higher.</li></ol><p>It is worth evaluating your exact situation to determine how much money you are actually saving.</p><p>Also, I don’t want to imply that saving a couple of hundred bucks isn’t worth the time — it certainly is. I will gladly give my insurance company a call if it saves me money. That lizard has been good to me.</p><p>However, these savings don’t come for free. You are leaving a significant amount of money in a stock that you may or may not want to own.</p><p>Therefore; my advice to you is this. Sell the damn shares. Put them in <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager\">betterment</a>. You can thank me later.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3aa34f187cfb\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-non-boring-advise-about-your-employee-stock-purchase-plan-3aa34f187cfb\">A non boring advice about your employee stock purchase plan</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We sat down for a chat about life and work when his grandmother decided to walk into the room. She joined us at the table and then looked at me with excitement. “Have you heard of BitCoin?” she asked. She then followed that with “I heard it’s an opportunity of a lifetime. You can be rich. Quick!”.</p><p>Now this story is totally made up but the lesson here is not to be missed. As a rule of thumb, if everyone is talking about some amazing investment opportunity, it’s probably already too late to make real money. This includes houses, gold, stocks or whatever fad comes next. This isn’t to say that you can <strong>never </strong>make money. You definitely could! But you have to be aware that at that point it is just a gamble.</p><p>The reasons for this argument are a bit complex but are discussed at length in the book “Irrational Exuberance” By <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Shiller\">Robert J. Shiller</a>. He has a Noble prize so he’s got to be on to something. The gist of it though is that humans are very much like cattle. We learn from each other and we follow each other. We’re also very prone to create market bubbles and over evaluate assets due to that herd mentality.</p><p>One other reason that I think people end up with bubbles that’s not as frequently discussed is that it’s plain exciting. People love winning. I have a few colleagues who have made several thousand dollars off trading crypto-currencies. They love talking about them and which one is growing at what rate or what high it hit. However, since pretty much all the major crypto-currencies are up, it’s hard to not make money over the last few years. You don’t need any special skills. Although that’s probably missed by them.</p><p>Also, I can’t help myself but see the parallels between this and <strong>every single other asset bubble in history</strong>. I’m talking about gold a few years ago, housing before that, and tech before that (and probably now). Every single time it ends in tears and the witch hunt starts for who mislead the public.</p><p>This article is going out on the interwebs for my millions of readers to see. That means that a few years from now someone could be reading this as they are paying their rent with some tiny fraction of BitCoin and laughing at my conclusions. I am well aware of it. This could be an absolute revolution in our financial system. And that’s great. Until then, I’m keeping my money in a well diversified index fund.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=218a528a85b1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/make-it-rain-with-bitcoin-clickbait-218a528a85b1\">I got a sure investment for you.

Anecdotal evidence about multiple bids on some broken down shitty houses with no pictures on RedFin and how many hundreds of thousands over asking the house down the street sold for dominate.</p><p>This in turn tends to drive the renters between us to go on a buying frenzy, desperately looking for a house, any house to buy. Because you know… if you don’t buy today, you’ll be priced out forever. I know I’ve heard that many times; including here in Seattle.</p><p>The same people always bring up the same examples. Look at San Francisco they say. Seattle (or insert the city that you live in) is the next San Francisco. “If I bought ten years ago I could have retired today”.</p><p>So here’s my contrarian theory. Now this probably doesn’t apply in all cases 100% of the time. But, ask yourself this:</p><blockquote>Were you ever priced in to the city in the first place?</blockquote><p>For example, San Francisco has always been more expensive then Seattle by about a <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/will-seattle-really-become-the-next-san-francisco/\">factor of two</a>. If you happened to be the age that you are now, working in San Francisco a decade ago, could you afford it then? Keep in mind that it’s very unlikely your salary would be the same.</p><p>I’m not just talking about inflation. I’m thinking more broadly like what industry you’re in. Are you in tech or nursing? You’re probably making way more money then you could a decade ago. These jobs are simply in higher demands now.</p><p>So when your Grandpa reminds you how he bought this house for 60k, don’t forget to ask him how much he was earning per hour. It could make a lot of difference. Now, if you couldn’t buy it then and you can’t buy it now does not mean you shouldn’t strive for it. I am just suggesting that we should keep this in mind when complaining about the state of affordability and how Amazon “ruined” everything.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a7d996fd0f49\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/being-priced-out-a7d996fd0f49\">Being priced out</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s the phenomena I would describe as irrational under-appreciation of money. I would love <a href=\"http://danariely.com/\">Dan Ariely</a>’s opinion about this.</p><p>Here’s a scenerio: You’re planning your wedding. Your partner is going through all the little things that need to be done. You, as the financially savvy “finance guy” add up all the costs and realize this wedding is going to cost you roughly $15,000.</p><p>Now, we all know that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@osportfolio/am-i-chasing-money-a59a1b636cb1\">money is time</a> so a better question is, how much time is it going to cost you. You do the math and after the costs of working, commute, unwinding and the additional wardrobe you maintain, you take home roughly $10 an hour in savings so about 1500 hours of work. You bury your face in your hands and start crying.</p><p>This analysis is probably more then what 99% of people do when they make buying decisions. This is probably too much to really expect from most anyway. Plus I don’t think anyone would really want to do such an analysis each time they are about to buy coffee.</p><p>So how about a much simpler analysis. Take a purchase in your life that you think was a great decision. For example, I recently bought a roundtrip ticket to Ghana for roughly $1200 and figure out how many times you could do the same trip using the money you’re about to spend. This way, you’re not dealing with abstract figures but actual valuable human experiences (or things).</p><p>In this particular example, you could probably visit Ghana 14 times instead of having this extravagant wedding. So ask yourself this question, is this wedding worth 14 trips to Ghana. Of course, for that amount, you could probably visit all of Africa.</p><p>The idea is to equate it to something a little more concrete then just dollars so you grasp the value that you’re dealing with. I find that otherwise, the numbers are too abstract and throwing around $5000 is just as easy as $10,000 without realizing that you just doubled your cost.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=433d582e1e98\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/the-true-price-of-weddings-433d582e1e98\">The true price of weddings</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

While they are trying to sell it as a tax break for us in reality it’s probably a slight tax hike or almost meaningless tax break. The reason is that although the standard deduction is doubled, the personal exemption is eliminated.

Amidst all the distraction from the likes of Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, one may ask how is it possible to stay productive at all?</p><p>In my mind, there are many things that need to be my attention. However, I usually have a tendency to delay things as long as possible. People call it many things, but I call it <em>laziness. </em>😖</p><p>It could be writing a Medium article, finishing up a chunk of code, reviewing a technical document, or just replying to an email. When I’m left to my own devices, I would basically imagine all these things in my head and feel the insurmountable amount of work that needs done…</p><p>When that grim mood sets in, my hand would instinctively reach into my pocket and pull out my phone.</p><p>This had happened to me multiple times in the past, and it still does from time to time.</p><p>But something <em>changed</em>. Once I discovered the secret cure to counter this terrible disease, I’ve been able to be 10x more productive than before, and as a direct result, bring much more joy into my life. My steps have springs in them, and my every waking day I feel a sense of mission and accomplishment.</p><p>Now, let me share with you my personal secret weapon to increase productivity.</p><h3>MOMENTUM</h3><p>That’s it, I said it. Momentum. It’s a simple word, but a powerful force.</p><blockquote>Momentum is what picks you up when you’re down, keeps you going when you’re overwhelmed, and maintains your focus when you sense distraction.</blockquote><blockquote>Momentum gets rid of triviality, and drives action.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Momentum is the power to produce.</strong></blockquote><p>When I sense that my energy level is low, and yet there are heaps of stuff left to be done, I give myself a mental pat on the back and start with one simple goal: <strong>do one thing at a time</strong>.</p><p>Let me give you an example. I started writing this article on a Tuesday evening at 10.10pm after work. I had just worked out, cleaned up the place and felt really tired.</p><p>Yet, I promised my editor (<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a>) that I’ll write at least an article this week to demonstrate mindful living in my own life.</p><p>After I sat down on my bed, my first thought was, <em>“Hmm, there are other, better things I can do with my time. Let’s see what’s on Facebook before I get started…”</em></p><p>One thing led to another, and 10 minutes later I was<em> still</em> on Facebook. How often has this happened to you?</p><p>That’s when I told myself, <em>“OK, let’s try just one paragraph. Let’s see what happens…”</em></p><p>That’s the magic phrase,<strong> <em>let’s see what happens</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>Once you start doing something, the powerful magic of momentum will carry you forward without you knowing it.</p><p>Fast-forward 20 minutes later, and I’ve already written close to 500 words. Much of it will probably be edited out in post-processing, but that’s OK. I have outdone myself, and wrote more than what I set out to do.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important thing is to realize that productivity doesn’t mean getting things done to perfection. Productivity, to me, <strong>means to execute and follow-through</strong>. Getting something out there is much better than nothing at all.</p><p>Once you have momentum behind you, it is much easier to follow that flow and drive things to completion.</p><h3>Tips &amp; Tricks for Building Momentum</h3><p>Here is a list of tips &amp; tricks I use to build momentum in my daily life:</p><ul><li>I <strong>block out a chunk of time</strong> on my calendar every day for my own space. For example, on my work calendar, there’s a chunk of time from 3–5pm that is allocated for coding. I have understanding teammates who don’t book meetings on those power-hours because it’s important for me to keep sanity and have time to myself to do things I need to do.</li><li><strong>Fill in mundane tasks with something productive</strong>. Reading more books is one of my goals for this year. When I feel overwhelmed and need to get away, I’ll try to pull out a book or listen to an audiobook on Spotify. I have a book in my backpack at all times, and having something to put my mind into is very helpful in those situations. The goal here <strong>is to build a productive habit</strong>, and you can replace reading with something else like working out or taking out the trash.</li><li><strong>Set a schedule and stick to it.</strong> Working out is something I dread, yet it’s important for my overall health. Earlier this year when I sat down and analyzed why I wasn’t working out more, I realized that having to drive to the gym and mentally set myself in work-out mode was time-consuming and counter-productive. What I did, then, was I built my own little home gym. My small gym only has some free weights and a bench, but the effects are tremendous. Every day, I’ll spend 30–40 minutes in the gym either lifting or doing a quick jog. Again, I build momentum here by just showing up. <strong>80% of the battle is already won when you show up, and that’s the beauty of momentum</strong>.</li></ul><p>Those are just some examples of how I use momentum in my daily life to drive productivity. I’d like to know if you have any productivity tips to share as well!</p><h3>Credits</h3><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> for proof-reading and providing valuable feedback!</p><p><em>Zhia Chong is a student of mindful living.

It is clear that earning fulfillment along the way is as important as reaching to the end goal. A friend asked me a very important question: <em>how do we enjoy every moment while still having a sense of a future goal? </em>I think of it this way:</p><blockquote><strong>Completion of a big goal = SUM(small daily action)</strong></blockquote><p>For example, my goal to write a book is far-fetch and has always been postponed. Writing one page every week (for 3 years) actually seems more achievable! The only way to get myself to write repeatedly is to <em>build the habit around it.</em></p><h3><strong>Deliberately building habits</strong></h3><p>My favorite book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526875534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+power+of+habit\">Power of Habit</a> suggests that any habit consists of 3 parts.</p><blockquote>First, there is a <strong>cue</strong>, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the <strong>routine</strong>, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a <strong>reward</strong>, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop… becomes more and more automatic<em>.</em></blockquote><p>Defining the cue is crucial. What worked best for me is to select a specific time, location, and vibe all together as a cue. I pick my favorite instrumental music, and sit on the couch on Sunday morning to get my brain engaged. I do my writing routine. Then I publish it to get the readers’ feedback as a reward. It gets easier over time as the habit is formed.</p><p>Majority of the time, I forget about the overarching goal and mostly enjoy doing my routine.<strong> The right set of habits can maximize your sense of fulfillment while still keeping you on track for the long term achievement.</strong></p><h3>Replacing bad habits</h3><p>Now that we know what is the good habits to keep or create, it’s time to get rid of the not-so-good habits. The best way is to replace the routine.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Keeping the same cue and reward; substituting the routine.</em></strong></blockquote><p>Say I want to stop checking social media first thing in the morning. First, I must identify the cue and the reward. I know the cue is the sound of the alarm clock, and the reward is the feeling of being awake afterwards. I choose to replace social media with reading (since it contributes to my long term goal). I delete the social media apps and replace them with reading apps. It feel a bit different at first, but overtime, the brain gets the same reward and it adjusts to the change. This strategy works all the time as long as you understand your cue and reward.</p><p>Identifying a good habit and deliberately replacing the bad ones is a continuous process. Overtime, I come to a set of habits that I do daily.</p><h3><strong>Realize enemy of habits</strong></h3><p>Life can’t be all planned. Many times, the unplanned events must override the schedule and break your flow. It can even break the yearly habit in a day. Spontaneous habit changes must happen to match the circumstances. This is perhaps the most difficult part about operating life on a set of habits.</p><blockquote><strong>The best way to cope with change is to be self-aware, constantly reflecting upon the self and understanding our own desire.</strong></blockquote><p>Being self-aware also helps with reinforcing the habit consciously when the cues or rewards are missing. It’s a fallback mechanism to maintain a long lasting habit.</p><h3>Super Habit</h3><p>Like any other goal, self-awareness can be practiced and strengthened. I found the <strong>habit of meditation </strong>to contribute highly to self-awareness. The mind is just like the body. It needs to be well-maintained and exercised.</p><p>Meditation gives the mind a chance to reorganize all the information. It is also a practice to de-focus on the past and future, and re-focus on what happens in the present. With higher consciousness, the mind is sharpened to understand and deal with uncertainty in life better.</p><p>I would denote meditation as my super habit because it keeps all other habits together. (I will write more about this later!)</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I believe that the better the plan, the easier the execution. <em>The journey to complete your big goal must be thought through</em>. Building good set of habits and maintain them is the fastest way to get there.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6cf095b2eacd\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/how-to-build-the-right-set-of-habits-6cf095b2eacd\">How I build the right set of habits</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Don’t get me wrong, I am not depressed (all my friends can testify!). In fact, I am happy, just not as much as I think I should be. Nothing is seriously wrong or need to be fixed about my life. I have a great paying job, amazing friends and brilliant co-workers, and I feel strong and healthy. Yet I still want to be happier.</p><p>For the past week, I pursued a quest to measure my own happiness. This is surprisingly difficult. The feeling of happiness is not a boolean but a scale. I can roughly estimate an average of 7/10 daily happiness level. I wonder where the missing 3 went.</p><p>Where does 7 came from, you may ask. I imagine my happiness point is derived from some sort of goal or task completion. It could be a small task like doing groceries or a bigger goal like getting a promotion. To explain my thought process better, I made a formula out of it.</p><p>Assume that one atomic unit of happiness is called <em>joy</em>. Each task or goal completion can spark X amount of <em>joy </em>based on level of challenge. My todo list on the weekend looks like this.</p><ul><li>Water a plant <em>= 5 joy after completion</em></li><li>Clean up my bathroom <em>= 30 joy after completion</em></li><li>File taxes <em>= 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium <em>= 100 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>Let’s say my threshold of happiness per day is at 100. If I complete everything in the list (even filing taxes!), I should have a very happy Saturday. Well, the truth is.. not really.</p><blockquote>The pure happiness I feel from achieving goals is only temporary. A better goal is contentment or fulfillment.</blockquote><p>The formula above fails to capture the sense of fulfillment, which comes from having a purpose and being present in the moment. That is why focusing on goal completion alone is for amateurs. We need to feel consistent fulfillment throughout the journey to the goal.</p><p>How should I represent fulfillment in this formula? Since fulfillment is all about enjoying the moment, it should perhaps be represented as <em>joy gain per minute (as long as we feel happy in those minutes)</em>. As time progresses, total fulfillment is equal to the <em>joy/min multiplied by the time spend. </em>Let’s try the formula again.</p><ul><li>Watch Netflix (1 hour)<em> = 1 joy/min + 0 joy after completion</em></li><li>File tax (3 hours) <em>= 0 joy/min + 50 joy after completion</em></li><li>Complete my first blog on Medium (~5 hour) <em>= 0.2 joy/min + 40 joy after completion!</em></li></ul><p>You may argue that the fulfillment gain may not always progress linearly with time. For example, if my Medium post took more than 5 hours to write, I would gain no more fulfillment after the 5 hours past. I agree! Well, for the sake of simplicity, let’s ignore that for now and assume only the upper bound of fulfillment that you can reach. Now let’s categorize all tasks into one of the three buckets.</p><ul><li><strong>Highly fulfilling activity. </strong>The activities such as watching Netflix, or drinking with friends are highly fulfilling but provides zero achievement afterwards.</li><li><strong>Pure achievement.</strong> These activities could be painful to go through but yield accomplishment afterward such as cooking, searching for a bike to buy, or filing tax. I wish I could just finish them quickly.</li><li><strong>Highly fulfilling with sense of achievement. </strong>I have only handful of these in my life such as reading a book, learning to snowboard, or writing this blog post.</li></ul><p>This lens is helpful to detach myself from the end-goal ultra focus, and constantly reminding myself to <em>live</em> in the moment. I start thinking of my day as the combination of <em>30% fulfillment and 70% achievement and started optimizing for the third bucket.</em> Many mundane tasks like folding clothes or biking can also be extremely fulfilling and could be part of the bigger goal achievement (if you think about it hard enough).</p><blockquote>Slowly, I feel that completing the goal has become less important, but having the right balance is more crucial to my overall happiness.</blockquote><p>Thank you for reading it this far.

Everyone is always trying to change something about themselves. The typical things includes the food they eat, the amount of exercise they get, how they spend their time and how they prioritize their lives. Turns out, change is harder than reading a blog online.</p><p>People are also creatures of habit. We all have our morning routines, our night routines, our commute to work routine and the web sites we visit on our lunch break routine. In fact, when we are put in new environments where executing our routines is hard, we generally tend to skip workouts and eat fried chicken for dinner.</p><p>I am going to share with you an approach that I use to form better habits. It is not fool proof. It does require some upfront investment. However, I believe it could work for almost any habit you are trying to form as long as you apply enough creativity. The system is very simple to apply. All you have to do is <em>create a system. </em>Yes, you read that right, the system is to create systems. Let me explain.</p><p>When I say “system”, I’m talking about a set of rules, or guidelines you use to guide your choices. The side effect of those rules should be that you execute your desired habit. Think of these rules as formalizing a contract with yourself. The contract has at least one rule: <em>I can have as much [A] as I want. However, before I get [A], I must do [B]</em>. This is what I call a personal contract.</p><p>The inspiration came from <a href=\"https://www.bjfogg.com/\">Dr. BJ Fogg</a>, a researcher in behaviour design who had a great TED talk a few years back about this exact topic.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%3Fstart%3D689%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D689&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAdKUJxjn-R8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAdKUJxjn-R8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href\">https://medium.com/media/8e74f2943de279ac487e645f7aff9a33/href</a></iframe><blockquote>If you use an existing behaviour in your life, and you put the new, tiny behaviour <em>after </em>it, you can use the existing behaviour to be the trigger.</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, over time, I noticed that simply defining the contract wasn’t always enough. Frequently, I couldn’t uphold the contract for long or I would completely forget about it. In fact, it was really a hit or miss — occasionally it would work really well but periodically it would completely fall apart.</p><p>More recently, I took a look at some personal contracts I was able to maintain for a long stretch and tried to boil it down to what made them different. I have identified four hallmarks of a good personal contract.</p><p><strong>Automatic.</strong> If you can set this up for your desired habit, your job is practically done. For example, before I spend any money, I max out my 401k. I can automate this through my paycheque contributions. Done!</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to automate certain areas of your life. Exercising effectively requires you to be doing exercise. Calling your mom once a week requires you to talk (at least for now).</p><p>However, there’s a clear subset of bad habits that can be automated away. Anything digital will naturally fall here. Do you have bad browsing behaviour? Are you spending too much time on your Twitter/Facebook/YouTube ? There’s an app for that. Are you having trouble saving or budgeting? There’s a bank for that.</p><p>The advantage of automating bad habits away is you only have that upfront cost once but you reap the dividends indefinitely.</p><p><strong>Breaks down barriers. </strong>One habit that I recently found to be absolutely effortless is the habit of eating a healthy lunch. In the past, I’ve tried cooking at home or buying out healthy lunches but inevitably you skip cooking for a few nights and end up ordering a large barbacoa burrito at Chipotle. You do it enough times and getting back to cooking regularly becomes more and more unlikely.</p><p>How many barriers can you identify with my past system? First, cooking at home is a pain in the ass. Second, when buying food outside, there are far too many temptations. Third, even if I manage to convince myself to buy a salad, in the back of my mind I’m always thinking it’s a bad a deal because I’ll stay hungry after that salad.</p><p>Here is my new approach: my current employer provides catered lunches every day. I made a personal contract with myself to eat a giant bowl of salad from the salad bar first. <strong>Once</strong> I’m finished with the bowl, I can have absolutely <strong>anything</strong> I want. There are no limits. This contract addresses all barriers I’ve had for eating a healthy lunch. I don’t have to cook anything; I am not tempted by anything else since choices are limited; and I am not getting a bad deal because I can have anything I want afterwards. I just need to get through that bowl of salad first. As an added bonus, there’s very little I can eat once I’m done with the salad. I tend to be much more ambitious when hungry.</p><p>In general, try and identify all the little excuses you are giving yourself to stop doing what you really want to be doing. Once identified, try to design your life in a way that will break down those excuses in the most effortless way possible.</p><p>Other barriers usually include, distance, accessibility and ease of use. Watch out for these.</p><p><strong>Sets the correct incentive.</strong> You know how we said before you get [A] you must do [B]? Make sure that whatever [A] is, it is motivating enough to act as a trigger. If you remember reading my <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/commitments-for-2018-8e10476e7640\">commitments for 2018,</a> you’ll recall that one of my commitments was to drink two cups of coffee a day. Unfortunately, I’ve noticed that as time goes on, I am creeping back to three cups. Each time I have it, I feel a little guilty but I reason that starting tomorrow I’ll be better. Instead of feeling guilt, I can turn this around and use it to my advantage.</p><p>I am a member of a gym located in the same building where I work. I am making the following personal contract: each time I feel like having a third cup of coffee, I must <strong>first</strong> hit the gym. The barriers to work out are exceedingly low and now I also have a great incentive to do the right thing (the fact that I made it public is a bonus).</p><p>You can generalize this approach as well. Essentially, you sacrifice one minor bad habit to enforce and carry out a major good habit by setting up the right incentives for yourself.</p><p><strong>Consistent with the individual.</strong> Sometimes, despite all the automation, best intentions, lowest barriers, and most enticing incentives, you still fail at your habit building; and that’s okay.</p><p>Coming up with these systems is an iterative process. You will always be tinkering with them. Always trying something new. Always looking for a better way of doing things. You’ll never get it just right the very first time.</p><p>The key is to keep trying new ways of doing things and experimenting with what works for you. For example, a cup of coffee might be enough to motivate me to go to the gym. You might want a new pair of sneakers instead. If that’s your barrier, don’t bother with my system. It won’t work for you.</p><p>When I come up with great systems that work for me, I am always very proud and happy to share — just wait until I write my post about budgeting.</p><p>Let me know if you have a system you are particularly proud of. I am always looking to tweak mine and share with others.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ac415f0a8c79\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-state-of-the-art-system-to-goal-setting-ac415f0a8c79\">My state of the art system to goal setting</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I can’t remember exactly what we were discussing but it must have been something interesting. It usually is. Suddenly, Zack asks me the following question:</p><blockquote>Where do you see yourself in five years?</blockquote><p>I haven’t been to an interview in a long time so I was caught off guard. I didn’t have a good enough, well rehearsed and politically correct answer to give. Then again, I wasn’t being actually interviewed for a job so I told him the honest truth. The truth is, I think that planning five years ahead is pointless if not counterproductive. I am sure that every lifestyle/productivity guru on the internet is having a meltdown right now. However, let me explain.</p><p>Presumably, setting a long term goal means the outcome is important to you. It is probably something that will make you happy and make you feel like a more accomplished person. Or will it? We’ve talked about this before. <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/happiness-our-want-system-vs-like-system-8daa263fd80a\">What you think will make you happy doesn’t always make you happy</a>. You just may end up on the hamster wheel chasing the next goal.</p><p>More importantly, the goals that you set for yourself today might not even be applicable five years from now. Let me give you a concrete example. I’ll steal this one from Nina because it works out perfectly. She mentioned that one of her friends has five year goal to open up her own brewery. That sounds really fun right? However, how sure is this friend that brewing beer is what she really wants to do? Five years from now, her priorities could change completely. Has she spent enough time brewing beer for herself? Is she sure that running her own business is something that she wants?</p><p>Another mistake a lot of people make when setting their long term goals is making goals that are outside of their control. For example, you can set a goal for yourself to get married. Is that a good goal? I don’t think so. Yes, one way to hand over more control to yourself is to lower your expectations but I don’t think that’s what you had in mind when committing to this five years earlier.</p><p>So far I’ve just been warming up. Sure, all of the above is true, but the real reason five year goals are pointless is much simpler. The unpredictability of life makes it so. For example, five years ago I was happily living in Canada when all of a sudden I got an opportunity to work at a much fancier company for much fancier pay. All my five year plans had to be abandoned (if I had any). Two days ago my wife came back from Portugal and is convinced life is better over there. What’s my five year plan now?</p><p>I can hear all the detractors from my couch grumbling under their breath about how I just don’t understand the goal setting process. It doesn’t have to be this specific or set in stone. That’s true! However, how generic are you thinking? The reality is that once you make it somewhat generic, everyone wants roughly the same. Everyone wants to be healthier, stronger, better looking with a devoted spouse and a killer job. So what? How are you getting there? The devil is in the details.</p><p>I am not here just to be a <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/07/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-complainypants/\">complainypants</a>. I also like to propose solutions. So here it goes: Do whatever you do to set your five year goal but set it for only <strong>one</strong> year ahead. Do this every year. At the end of the year, reevaluate and readjust. A year is generally enough to set substantial but achievable goals. At the same time, when things change — either your surrounding or your opinions — you have plenty of opportunity to reevaluate what you value and where you’re heading.</p><p>You can experiment with shorter periods of time as well, however, I suspect that if you do this too frequently, you won’t be giving yourself enough time to complete the goal. At the same time, you’ll be giving yourself a lot of opportunities to quit. One year seems like a good balance between some level of accountability and flexibility.</p><p>The key to make this recurring one year goal work is the <strong>reevaluation</strong> part of the process. Each year, you must check back on the goals you set for yourself in the beginning of year and evaluate your performance. Furthermore, reevaluate if you want to continue with this goal. Finally, and most importantly, step up the difficulty level of the goal.</p><p>I think of this as “managed personal growth”. <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2018 should be better in every way than <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> of 2017. If not, <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e68c5c9127bb\">Open source portfolio</a> wasted 2017.

All <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-favourite-part-of-new-year-c043c0e69e97\">resolutions and steps</a> are listed together with a semi-monthly grade. Overall, I must admit that I am happy with my performance this year. This was the first year that I tried this and it worked out really well. I highly recommend everyone to try it for 2018.</p><p>The way I’ve presented it here is the overall goal is bolded and the steps that I’ve taken and graded myself on are underneath. Each column represents two months. I’ve started the year by giving myself a grade between A-F but in April switched to a numbered system. It seemed more intuitive.</p><p>Also, you’ll see a dash in some places. Those could mean one of two things. Either it’s a goal that I’ve decided is not worth pursuing anymore or it’s a goal that I came up with mid year and did not have data points from earlier.</p><h4><strong>Minimize the number of items that I own</strong></h4><pre>╔═════════════════════════╦════╦═══╦════╦════╦════╦═══╗<br>║ Each item has a purpose ║ A  ║ B ║  7 ║  8 ║  8 ║ - ║<br>║ Stay item neutral       ║ A+ ║ A ║ 10 ║ 10 ║ 10 ║ 9 ║<br>╚═════════════════════════╩════╩═══╩════╩════╩════╩═══╝</pre><p><strong><em>Bottom line:</em></strong> Last quantile started off rough as we were accumulating a lot of stuff but we ended the last week of the year by donating a lot to Goodwill.

That means my favourite time of year is coming. It’s that special time when you make new year resolutions which you will break in February. All the good intentions and wishful thinking that comes head to head with the cold hard reality. What a beautiful thing.</p><p>Since I’m painfully aware of how hard it is to stick to new year resolutions, over the years I’ve come up with a pretty intricate system of rules and reminders to allow me to meet my goals. This is going to be a short summary of how I make my new year resolutions and a plea for all of you dear readers to come up with your own.</p><p>Let’s start with what you shouldn’t do. You should not, by any means, make bullshit new year resolutions. I’m talking about resolutions such as “be happy with what I have” or “be kinder to myself” (You know who I’m talking about). This sort of resolutions are completely useless for two reasons.</p><p>First, resolutions should not be abstract. It has to be something reasonably concrete. Ideally something that you can point to and say, look I did that. For example, completing a certain long standing project would be a very concrete goal whose success you can measure.</p><p>Second, it needs to be something you can break up into smaller steps. That way you can implement it throughout the year. For example, if you want to read 12 books in 2018, each book would be a step that brings you closer to your goal. Being kind to yourself is a failure on both criteria.</p><p>But enough with negativity. Let’s talk about what you should do. Since I’m old, with a vast amount of experience through my years of failure, I’ve discovered one key attribute that will make meeting your new year resolutions 10 times easier. The key to meetings them is <strong>accountability.</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/315/1*DBGdHlkB6DVjBy62d3TANQ.gif\" /></figure><p>Yes I know, it’s a pretty obvious statement but it doesn’t tell much does it? So here’s the three things that I did in 2017 and found extremely helpful.</p><p><strong>Write your goals down. </strong>To be honest, I’ve read more books than I can count that advised me to write something down on a piece of paper. I never did. It’s a pain in the ass. Not to mention I’ll probably lose the paper. However, writing down your goals is important because you’re likely going to forget them. Unless of course you’re always wishing to lose weight.</p><p>Additionally, writing them down can be really easy in something like Google Sheets. You pop it open, write a few things and it’s saved for eternity. That’s what I’ve done. As a side benefit, if you keep up this habit, you get to see what you were trying to achieve over the years as long as you reuse the same spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>Write down the steps for each goal. </strong>So remember what not to do #2? Make sure you do the opposite when picking your goals and then in that same spreadsheet, under each goal, write down the practical steps you can do to meet your goal. For example, if your goal is to take better care of your health, you can list things like work out frequency and diet changes that you will be implementing as part of the goal.</p><p><strong>Grade yourself regularly. </strong>Here’s how it works. Open up whatever calendar you use and create a recurring event once every two months to remind you to check in on your goals. Each time you check in, give yourself a grade for each step and an overall grade for the goal itself. This works well because you get a regular reminder of what it is that you were trying to do for the year.</p><p>The conventional way of declaring a new year resolution on December 31st fizzles out quickly as life piles on with commitments and obligations. I would argue that most people can’t even remember their new year resolution from 2016 and definitely not from 2015. By reminding yourself what you wanted to achieve for the year, each time you veer off course, you get an opportunity to realign.</p><p>I have a check in coming up on December 28th for all my resolutions for 2017. I’ll post them on the blog together with my resolutions for next year. Stay tuned.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c043c0e69e97\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/my-favourite-part-of-new-year-c043c0e69e97\">My favourite part of new year</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Nor is it second since I’ve never established the first one. It’s more of an observation that I had recently regarding minimalist living and why it works.</p><p>Now, you’re probably vaguely familiar or remember the idea of the second law of thermodynamics. To summarize it in a non-sciencey way, it’s essentially the idea that things tend towards disorder unless outside energy is applied. A good example of this is taking a bath. Initially, it is all nice and hot but after a while you realize the water has cooled down because the heat has escaped.</p><p>So what does that have to do with minimalism? I think you can draw a neat parallel between thermodynamics and ownership of things (or obligations). It’s also a great way to better understand two things</p><ol><li>Why are you unhappy with everything you have</li><li>How can having less possibly make you happier</li></ol><p>Let’s imagine yourself owning a very basic set of dishes. You have nothing beyond a single plate, knife, fork and spoon. Also, washing dishes isn’t exactly your favourite activity. Life is pretty tough. What can we do to improve it?</p><p>One thing we can do is add a cup. Now you’re able to enjoy water comfortably instead of trying to collect it in your hands. Sounds pretty great no? Your happiness should improve dramatically. I have no doubt that drinking water without a cup is adding a lot of unnecessary inefficiency to your life. This is also the overall thought process that people go through when determining if they need to purchase something or not.</p><p>But there’s one thing we’ve overlooked. We forgot to account for the cost of maintenance for this item. I use maintenance as a general form to refer to actions like storing the item, washing the item and finding the item. All trivial indeed but don’t forget, all we have is one set of everything. In this case, the trivial maintenance cost is just that. Trivial.</p><p>Maintenance becomes a problem as the number of items that you own increases. Each of them providing a diminishing return for your convenience but increases the maintenance somewhat linearly. For example, getting another cup would mean another person can have a drink with me but all the above maintenance costs just doubled.</p><p>This maintenance cost comes to us in two primary forms. The first is at the cost of our time. We have to spend time washing the cup and putting it away. But also, it comes in the form of mental clutter. This will arise when you don’t take care of the maintenance tasks immediately and they start pilling up.</p><p>You can extrapolate this further to all the items that you own. And you own A LOT. Like thousands a lot. Each may take 1–10 seconds in maintenance on average so together it takes a significant chunk of your day. And before you realize it, you spend a significant portion of your free time just putting things back together, finishing up unfinished projects and just basic cleaning. No wonder you don’t have any time.</p><p>The second law of minimalism is this:</p><blockquote>Everything has it’s cost. Make sure you understand it well</blockquote><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c487f90a8ff3\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/second-law-of-minimalism-c487f90a8ff3\">Second law of minimalism</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I find the idea very attractive. And it seems <a href=\"https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp01-mobile-phone/\">I’m not the only one either</a>. It will ensure that my phone usage decreases dramatically while still giving me a way out in case I’m in trouble or if someone is looking to reach me.</p><p>The problem is that dumb phones are missing certain key apps that I rely on heavily. For example, I like having Google maps for orientation. I mentioned this idea to my wife and to my surprise she questioned my basic assumptions. She asked me when was the last time I was suddenly lost. Could I not look up my path prior to going there and print out the directions? You know, like we used to do.</p><p>That’s a valid point. I think I like the idea of having maps a lot more then I actually need them. I’m certain there’s very few instances that I suddenly needed them because of some unforeseen circumstances. So what’s really holding me back?</p><p>Another thing I could think of was various messengers I use to communicate with my friends around the country. That one is a little tougher since everyone have their messenger of choice and platform fragmentation isn’t helping the situation. At any one time I have 3 messengers running to talk to different groups of people. I’m not trying to claim it’s unsolvable problem but it’s definitely inconvenient.</p><p>In her eternal brilliance, my wife asked me, what was actually bothering on my smartphone? In other words, what was I spending most of my time on? I admitted that it was email. I like to check it far more often then I should. So she dropped this bomb on me:</p><blockquote>Why don’t you uninstall it?</blockquote><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*z4EH4w8cXKVSoQcHcck0Aw.jpeg\" /></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2d37da108413\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/dumbphone-alternative-2d37da108413\">Dumbphone alternative</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Another thing that I try to avoid when I’m <strong>not</strong> around people is to stick my face in my smartphone. In general I don’t like the idea of spending my precious life minutes looking at electronics.</p><p>Now, obviously it is unavoidable to some extent. It is mandatory in my line of work. It is also necessary to write this piece. But Ideally, if it’s not necessary, in a perfect world, I would have the phone somewhere far away.</p><p>To some extent I’ve been reasonably successful. I keep my phone charging in the bedroom when I get home. I also removed all social media apps so I don’t spend time pointlessly scrolling through feeds of food, cats and random vacation pictures.</p><p>One of the most powerful things I’ve managed to do though was to turn off notifications in most of my apps (that tend to notify). For example, email, Whatsapp and the like. I found that my anxiety level around my phone has decreased dramatically after that. The cost of doing that is of course you might not reply to a message immediately.</p><p>Now, I’m far from perfect and I still find myself looking at my phone more then I would like. I still check my email too often and still stick around on the toilet longer then I should just because I’m browsing the news.

Of course there is. In one scenario you get to drive a brand new SUV to work with shiny new rims and an obnoxiously loud exhaust pipe, and the other you’re po’. I don’t think I need to explain which one is which. No one would dispute this.</p><p>However 😃, there is one important assumption we made. The assumption is that being po’ (that’s short for “poor” if someone is unclear) is bad and driving an SUV is good. In other words, we are talking about a basic, familiar consumer lifestyle. That is probably a fine assumption. Nonetheless, what if you’re an effai seeker? Apparently it’s <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5241566/vicki-robin-financial-independence-retire-early/\">all the rage with millennials</a>. You’d have to reconsider those assumptions.</p><p>The reason for this is very simple. If you are seeking effai, your goal isn’t to burn through as many resources as possible during your lifetime. Your goal is to get a <em>minimum amount of resources you need — and as early as possible</em>. That’s quite a different form of consumption.</p><p>So what gets you there sooner? By being “poor” you end up spending less money.</p><p>Spending less money means you require less money to live on.</p><p>Requiring less money to live on means you can save it up faster. That’s pretty simple math.</p><p>With this in mind, we can now return to the original question: Is a penny saved, as good as a penny earned? The answer to that is absolutely not. It’s far better.</p><p>Let’s take Hank and Lenny as an example (I have debated this with my friend Hank many times although I am somewhat misrepresenting his stance). For convenience, let’s also assume they have roughly the same standard of living costing $60k annually (or $5k monthly). They also save the same $3k per month. At that rate, and with some reasonable assumptions, it would take them about 16 years to reach effai (you can check for yourself <a href=\"https://effai.me/\">here</a>). If they started at 20 and keeping life circumstances constant, they’d reach effai at 36.</p><p>Turns out though, that Hank is also a very hard worker and got promoted recently. He also got a nice pay bump to go along with a fancier title and is now able to save an <strong>extra</strong> $1k a month. In other words, he is socking away $4k monthly instead of $3k. That brings his <strong>T</strong>ime <strong>T</strong>o e<strong>F</strong>fai (TTF 😃) down to 13.7 years from 16 — a savings of 2.3 years. Not bad!</p><p>Lenny on the other hand is a cheapskate. Instead of making more money, Lenny decided to cut his expenses by $1k (Let’s ignore the how for the sake of this article). What does that mean for Lenny? Since Lenny cut his expenses, he now lives on $4k a month instead of $5k. That puts effai 13 years away. That’s an additional 0.7 years sooner than Hank.</p><p><strong>Additionally</strong>, since Lenny cut his expenses, by $1k without changing anything else, he just freed up $1k to put towards <strong>savings</strong>. Lenny is now able to also save $4k per month just like Hank. This makes effai only 11 years away — a full 5 years earlier then originally anticipated.</p><p>In short, each penny you save, from an effai view, actually has two roles. First, it’s a penny you don’t have to produce with your passive income anymore. Second, it’s a penny you can redirect towards savings — Increasing significantly your savings rate.</p><blockquote>So, no, a penny saved is not a penny earned, it’s two!</blockquote><p>There is actually one other way to look at all of this. I find this to be far more impressive to think about than 11 years versus 13.7 years. Consider instead how much less money you actually need. For example, let’s go back to Lenny. He went from spending $5k to $4k and increased his savings from $3k to $4k.</p><p>Now take the 4% rule. Oh? You’re not familiar with it? I realize that I haven’t written about it yet. I’ll summarize it super quickly for the sake of this article:</p><blockquote>You can passively earn a dollar a month forever by intelligently investing $300.</blockquote><p>Now take the 4% rule. By cutting $1k a month from what Lenny spends, Lenny does not need to intelligently invest $300k. In other words, Lenny just saved himself from saving $300k.</p><p>This gets a tiny bit better actually. You should never think of your retirement number in today’s dollars. You always have to take inflation into account. The $300k we just saved for Lenny is in today’s dollars. Since Lenny is retiring in 11 years — and with an inflation rate of 2%, Lenny shaved off a whopping $373k off his retirement number. Cha-ching.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=32a31bf45d8a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned-not-really-32a31bf45d8a\">A penny saved is a penny earned.

It’s our obsessive over consumption of sugar and refined carbohydrates.</p><p>Now, despite some resistance from the dark vegan armies, I’m pretty sure it’s obvious that diabetes and over consumption of sugar is closely related. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it’s a root cause of our exploding rate of type II diabetes. It makes perfect sense yet still remains controversial and unresolved.</p><p>Next we move on to heart disease. The number one killer in the world. That one I admit is a little more complicated but still I would implicate sugar as the cause. Studies in this space tend to be observational so there are no hard proofs but a lot of things seem to be aligning. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983261\">insulin resistance and heart disease are closely related</a>.</p><p>Now for some stretch goals. First, there’s cancer. I’m going based of this video but seems damn convincing to me.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSEE-oU8_NSU%3Fstart%3D2599%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D2599&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSEE-oU8_NSU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSEE-oU8_NSU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3d34be985deea66754cd2167f3c2e46e/href\">https://medium.com/media/3d34be985deea66754cd2167f3c2e46e/href</a></iframe><p>If a cancer cell requires abnormal amounts of glucose and we don’t provide it, it should starve.

But first, a few definitions:</p><ol><li><strong>Offering period</strong>: the period of time the participant is locked in to a particular stock purchase plan; typically this is 12 months.</li><li><strong>Purchase period</strong>: the frequency in which you purchase stock within your <strong>offering period</strong>; typically this is 6 months (meaning there’s two purchase periods in a typical offering period).</li></ol><p>Great, now that we’re up to speed, let’s pretend your company stock doubled between the beginning of the offering period and the purchase date 6 months later. Here’s the kicker: to get a long term capital gains rate on the <strong>gain</strong> beyond the company discount, you must meet two criteria.</p><ol><li>Hold the shares for 12 months from the purchase date AND</li><li>Hold the shares for 24 months from the beginning of the offering period.</li></ol><p>That means, half the time you must hold your company stock for a full 18 months before you get to enjoy the lower tax rate.</p><p>To summarize for the skimmers: any discount given to you by the employer is <strong>always </strong>taxed as regular income. Any gain beyond that may be taxed as long term capital gains but the shares must be held for 24 months after offering period starts.</p><p>If the stock price went down between the offering date and the purchase date, the decisions becomes a complete no-brainer. Sell immediately. There is no advantages to be gained.</p><p>If the stock is up and you’re thinking of holding on to save a couple of bucks, consider these:</p><ol><li>Would you buy the stock today at the current price?</li><li>Are you willing to hold on for up to 18 months to save around 10% of your gains?</li></ol><p>If it’s a resounding yes to both questions, go ahead and wait. If any of them is a no, sell immediately; then go ahead and open up a <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager\">betterment</a> account.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=75562e090432\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/correction-holding-espps-is-worse-than-i-thought-75562e090432\">Correction.

One of them is called an ESPP or employee stock purchase plan. It is a scheme by which the employer incentivizes you to purchase its stock using a portion of your salary. The incentive is usually some sort of a discount or top up.</p><p>One question that frequently comes up is what to do once the shares are vested into your account.</p><p>You can go down one of two roads. First, you can sell all the shares immediately and purchase something else. Spoiler alert, I’m in this camp.</p><p>Second, you can keep the shares.</p><p>The reasoning for keeping the shares is actually quite solid. If you’ve made money on the stock market and you’ve held the shares for less than a year, you are subject to good old fashion <strong>income</strong> tax. If, on the other hand, you held it for more than a year, you are subject to shiny new <strong>capital gains</strong> tax; and you guessed it, the shiny new capital gains taxes are usually lower.</p><p>This is exactly the argument I was having with my friend Aaron at work yesterday. Our shares from ESPP are set to vest in November and he was inquiring about my plans for the money. I told him I was going to sell everything and purchase a boring and dull index fund. He told me I was crazy for throwing my money away.</p><p>This discussion went on for longer then I am ready to admit but I thought I can summarize the lessons here. Also, since this is my blog, my opinion is right.</p><p>Let’s start with an example: Since Aaron is a well paid executive of a small company, his household income is $300,000. That puts Aaron at the 24% tax bracket. Aaron’s company offers a 15% discount on the share price. Finally, Aaron commits $20,000 to the ESPP plan.</p><p>First, it’s important to note that only your gains are taxed — not your entire investment. In this case, if you were to sell the shares immediately after vesting, your discount would be your only gain. In other words, 15% of $20,000 or $3000.</p><p>Second, uncle Sam would come calling for his portion of those $3000 at the end of the year. His share would be 24% of $3000 or $720 — that’s what you owe the government.</p><p>Third, if you were to keep the shares for a year, you are still not scot-free. The capital gains tax is still 15% of $3000 or $450.</p><p>By holding on to the shares for an entire year, you’ve saved yourself less than $270 ($720 minus $450) or roughly 1% of the entire sum. To put that into perspective, my company’s stock went down 4% yesterday (and up 17% today).</p><p>I don’t know about you but that does not seem like a good deal to me. Putting money in a single company is notoriously volatile. Doing it with the company you work for is a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1008712386485424000\">potential disaster</a>.</p><p>Of course, this is a somewhat contrived example. There are many other things to take into account</p><ol><li>If you’re filing individually and earning above $200,000, the <strong>gap </strong>between the income tax and capital gains tax is 20% instead of 9%. If you’re earning $38,000, the gap is actually negative (the income tax is lower). You can find the latest rates <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/\">here</a>.</li><li>If you contribute significantly more than $20,000 into the ESPP program your tax loss might be greater. Of course, that also means you must keep more money in a single stock.</li><li>If the incentive from your employer is larger, your tax could be greater. For example, when purchasing ESPP shares, my employer uses either the price today or the one from 6 months ago — whichever one is lower. As of this writing, the stock is up 10% from 6 months ago. My taxable gain is now higher.</li></ol><p>It is worth evaluating your exact situation to determine how much money you are actually saving.</p><p>Also, I don’t want to imply that saving a couple of hundred bucks isn’t worth the time — it certainly is. I will gladly give my insurance company a call if it saves me money. That lizard has been good to me.</p><p>However, these savings don’t come for free. You are leaving a significant amount of money in a stock that you may or may not want to own.</p><p>Therefore; my advice to you is this. Sell the damn shares. Put them in <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/invite/alontager\">betterment</a>. You can thank me later.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3aa34f187cfb\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/a-non-boring-advise-about-your-employee-stock-purchase-plan-3aa34f187cfb\">A non boring advice about your employee stock purchase plan</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We talked about all the different programs Uncle Sam offers to reduce our tax bill at the end of the year. There’s the traditional ones we hear about all the time like 401k’s and IRA. There’s a mention of a few less common ones as well. I encourage you to read it if you haven’t yet.</p><p>However, one of the most controversial options I mentioned was the Health Savings Account — also known as the HSA. Turns out, some people are not aware of all the super powers of the HSA and in turn ended up paying unnecessary taxes to the government. Thus; I’ve decided to break it down for you in a digestible way.</p><p>First, let’s talk about what HSA is used for. HSA is a savings account (I bet you didn’t see that coming) that allows you to save money for <strong>medical purposes</strong>. Each dollar that you set aside in an HSA is <strong>tax free. </strong>The money in the account can be invested in the stock market and grow tax free. Once you have a medical expense, the money can be withdrawn from the account, once again, tax free. You get the idea. One caveat is that HSA is only available for <strong>high deductible health plans.</strong></p><p>Of course, the government cannot allow you to put every single penny you earn towards medical expenses. There is a limit of $3,450 per person or $6,900 for a couple per year. That’s 2018 numbers.</p><p>Here’s a quick example of how it would work. Assume your household income for 2018 is $100,000. If you were to max out your HSA for you and your spouse, the government would tax you on $93,100 instead of the entire $100,000. That’s a free, ~$1500 you don’t have to pay in taxes!</p><p>Aside from federal income tax, there’s a few other taxes snuck into your pay stub. Two of them are social security and medicare — affectionately known as FICA. Together they add up to 7.65% of your income. Turns out, <strong>unlike</strong> <strong>all </strong>other retirement accounts available to you, HSA is the only one that is exempt from paying FICA taxes too. That’s another ~$500 in your deep pockets.</p><p>That’s just the beginning though. Once you’ve set aside the money in your HSA, the most powerful force in the universe takes over — compound interest. That’s because each dollar you’ve set aside can be invested and grow tax free. Naturally, as a FI (financial independence) pursuer, you’d invest it in a diversified index fund of stocks*. Over time, the growth alone could dominate any further contributions.</p><p>Let’s also address the elephant in the room. What do you do if you don’t need to spend all this money on health care? What if you’re healthy? Once again, you’re in luck. Aside from being healthy, once you hit 65, all the money saved up in your HSA can be used for <strong>anything </strong>penalty free. You heard that right; <strong>anything. </strong>Taxation is also simple. It is treated like regular income. In essence, your HSA becomes a traditional IRA. One exception is if HSA is used for medical purposes. In that case, withdrawals are still tax free.</p><p>This beast of Roth and Traditional IRA blended and fused together sounds like a great deal, doesn’t it? Should you then go ahead and switch your health plan at work to a high deductible plan as soon as possible? Probably.</p><p>However, there is one notable exception. If you tend to have high medical bills throughout the year, it doesn’t make much sense to switch to a higher deductible health plan. You could be better off forgoing the tax savings and letting the employer subsidize your health costs instead.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that some generous employers contribute to your HSA as well. It does count against your overall limit but free money is free money.</p><p>Finally, there’s always going to be a subset of people who are terrified of exposing themselves to a little bit more risk through the high deductible health plan. I suggest that you read my article addressing insurance in general appropriately named “<a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/what-to-insure-92da25663721\">what to insure</a>”. To summarize it in one sentence, I’d say, don’t worry about it if you can afford it.</p><p>*I need to write something an article, or more likely a series about stock investing for the FI pursuer.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ebdd3f35be8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/hsa-a-friend-on-the-road-to-financial-freedom-ebdd3f35be8\">HSA: a friend on the road to financial freedom</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I dread it because it’s that special time of the year. It’s the time you have to gather all those illegible slips you received from your employer and enter them in to some half baked software online. As you go through the process, the dollar amount you owe/receive will swing wildly making you break into a sweaty mess. All of this is coupled with a stack of indecipherable rules handed down to you from some government entity responsible for the tax collection.</p><p>The entire mess with all the pre-tax and post-tax deductions, itemization, credits, and exemptions makes it incomprehensible if all you want to do is “pay your fair share”. Additionally, once a tax break is given, it’s very hard to take it back. Thus; we end up with 80,000 pages of IRS lawyer talk.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if at least you could take advantage of all these rules?</p><p>That’s why, I’m going to explore here the following question: <em>What is the maximum amount you can earn without paying any federal tax?</em></p><p>To keep this manageable, I will make a few assumptions. First, you’re filing as a married couple. This is purely out of convenience for me since that’s how I file. If you are filing as a single person, most of the time you can just divide the number in half. Additionally, there is a pile of rules I’ll ignore for convenience. They either don’t apply to the vast majority of people or are insignificant for the bottom line. Also, I will ignore Medicaid and Social security taxes. Finally, I will ignore any possible employer contributions or matches into your retirement accounts.</p><p>Let’s start by defining a few terms.</p><p><strong>Pre-tax </strong>(or traditional) — A type of deduction for which you don’t have to pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>Post-tax</strong> (or roth) — A type of deduction for which you do pay tax upfront.</p><p><strong>401(k) — </strong>A retirement plan sponsored by your employer</p><p><strong>IRA — </strong>A retirement plan that you pay for yourself.</p><p><strong>Standard deduction — </strong>An amount every tax filer gets to deduct from their income to find their taxable income.</p><p><strong>Capital gains — </strong>The tax applied on an investment</p><p><em>Everything beyond will assume a pre-tax or traditional deduction. Roth deductions are for suckers. We will explore that next.</em></p><p>Now that we got the jargon out of the way, let’s see how we can apply it. We can start with the easiest. The standard deduction. It is $24,000 for a couple for the year 2018. If your family unit is bringing <strong><em>$24,000</em></strong> per year, the standard deduction would bring your taxable income down to $0. In turn, your taxes would be $0. Fantastic.</p><p>Next, you can contribute to a traditional IRA. The limits for traditional IRAs is $5500 per person or $11,000 per couple. Remember that a traditional IRA is a pre-tax deduction. Thus; you can earn an additional $11,000 per couple and pay $0 tax. We are now up to <strong><em>$35,000</em></strong>.</p><p>Similarly to IRA, you can also contribute to a traditional 401(k) program with your employer (if the employer is offering it). Each person has an IRS mandated limit of $18,500. Since you’re filing as a couple that gives you a total of $37,000 to deduct. Adding it to the above gives us a total of <strong><em>$72,000</em></strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>There’s one more easy pre-tax deduction left. The health savings account (HSA). This is a great choice for individuals with low medical expenses. Some highly respectable online individuals even describe it as the <a href=\"https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/\">ultimate savings account</a>. For 2018, the limit for a couple is $6,900. Adding that in to our total gives us <strong>$78,900</strong> tax free dollars.</p><p>In many cases, 401(k)’s and HSA’s come with a few more advantages. First, many employers are willing to match at least a part of your contributions. That usually amounts to a few thousand tax free dollars. Additionally, if you are 50 or older, 401(k)’s allow you to sock away another $6000 per individual. That’s another potential $12,000 to put away depending on your age.</p><p>Alright, we got all the obvious things out of the way. If you are not maximizing these, what are you waiting for?</p><p>Now let’s talk about the more esoteric options. First, there’s the 457(b). That’s a special program for government workers. If you are a teacher or a nurse or some other government worker you can usually participate in this plan. 457(b) plan has an interesting feature. Unlike other employer sponsored retirement plans, this option has a separate limit. That means you can contribute to both 401(k) and 457(b). Both also have the same limits. Therefore; if a couple works for the government, that’s an additional $37,000 that can be deducted. That would give you <strong>$115,900</strong> tax free dollars if my math is correct.</p><p>Of course this is not the Soviet Union. We don’t all work for the government. However, there is one other interesting way to reduce your taxes. If you went through my list of terms above, you may remember “capital gains”; the tax applied on investments. The great thing about this tax is that under certain conditions, when your investment “qualifies”, this tax can be 0 percent. You heard that right. You’ll pay nothing. The requirements are also relatively moderate. The main requirement is that your investment must be held for at least a year.</p><p>Once your investment is “qualified”, as long as you manage to keep your total <strong>taxable</strong> income to under $77,200, you’ll actually owe nothing to the government. Taxable is bolded on purpose. Remember that through the power of IRA’s, 401(k)’s and HSA’s we were able to earn $78,900 tax free. That’s because, for the purpose of taxation, you’ve earned $0. Now, if you were to earn an additional $77,200 from capital gains, that would still be taxed at 0 percent due to capital gains taxes. Amazing!</p><p>So what’s the bottom line?</p><p>As a couple with a decent job, you can earn <strong>$78,900</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the state or federal government, you can earn <strong>$115,900 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn an astonishing <strong>$193,100</strong> and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>As a couple above 50, working for the government and amassing an impressive portfolio, you can earn <strong>$205,100 </strong>and not pay a dime in taxes.</p><p>There’s a huge array of further deductions and credits you can look into to reduce your taxes further. If you prefer, you can think of it as increasing your taxable income while keeping your tax obligation at zero. For example, the child tax credit can give you up to $2000.</p><p>However, most of us are not working for the government and do not have a portfolio that can generate $80,000 in capital gains year after year. Yet we can still reduce are taxable income by almost $79,000. To put that in perspective, the median income of a <strong><em>married</em></strong> household in 2016 was roughly $87,000; a little more then you can deduct.</p><p>I’m a strong proponent of saving hard and saving fast. That’s why, I encourage everyone to participate in any government money give away that is available to them within the legal boundaries. Retirement savings programs are “use it or lose” it programs. Make sure you use it.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=737acc94778f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/most-money-you-can-earn-without-paying-a-dime-in-tax-737acc94778f\">Most money you can earn without paying a dime in tax</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, one thing got me really excited today. There were all these rumors that Trump was suppose to double our standard deduction.</p><p>I’ve been reading about this for a few months now but today’s reports made it all but certain. Now, I am not interested in discussing if this is good or bad. All I’m trying to say is it’s good for <strong>me</strong>. Or so I thought at least.</p><p>Turns out, just like everything else Trump does, it’s just a sleight of hands. While they are trying to sell it as a tax break for us in reality it’s probably a slight tax hike or almost meaningless tax break. The reason is that although the standard deduction is doubled, the personal exemption is eliminated. On top of it, the bottom tax bracket is actually going up from 10% to 12%.</p><p>So bottom line is, not much to get excited about.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4a2e7ba60b32\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me/about-the-new-tax-proposals-4a2e7ba60b32\">About the new tax proposals</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/effai-me\">Effai.me</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
